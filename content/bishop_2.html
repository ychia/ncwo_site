			<br/>To the Faithful and Beloved Saints of the Most High; Praise the Lord and God bless you this day. I pray you are all standing fast in the scriptures and preparing yourselves for that which lies ahead. I pray all of you were blessed with &quot;THE BISHOP MINISTRY--Part 1&quot;. Since we are commanded by God to PROVE all things, I pray you truly sat back and gave thought to that which you read.<br/><br/>The purpose of these writings is not to offend any man or woman. Nor is it the intention of condemning or falsely accusing any. Facts and truth are spoken. Even in the days of Paul, he wrote letters and WARNED his sons in the faith about certain men and their doctrines which were harming men spiritually. Paul used them by name.<br/><br/>1 Tim. 1:19-20<br/>Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: [20] Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.<br/><br/>2 Tim. 1:15<br/>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.<br/><br/>2 Tim. 4:14-15<br/>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works: [15] Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.<br/><br/>These men once walked with Paul but somewhere along the line they went astray and began to shipwreck others in their faith. Paul warned Timothy about these men and even told Timothy himself, to &quot;be ware&quot;.<br/><br/>Today, men say, &quot;How dare you judge&quot;? Excuse me, but did not Jesus say to us that WHEN we judge we are to do it righteously? So please, do not be offended or angry over anything spoken. Prayerfully you are rejoicing that Jesus loves us enough to speak HIS truth to us and keep us safe from doctrines that could deceive us and take us away from HIS straight path. Jesus said in Mt.7 that very few would find that narrow and straight way. Very few.<br/><br/>We are then called by the Holy Spirit to search the scriptures to see IF these things be so. PLEASE saints, do not just skip over the scriptures quoted in these teachings, but PLEASE read them, even if you already know them, read them for the context that they are spoken for. For some of you, this may have been the very first time you ever heard such a teaching. If so, then Praise God and I also would be thankful in knowing you went to the Word of God to see IF these things be so. Sadly again, many today become so set in THEIR ways, that when revelation of the Kingdom comes, they reject it. We must all remember that our ways of thinking are not our LORD'S ways. For this cause we MUST:<br/><br/>Philip. 2:5<br/>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:<br/><br/>Romans 12:2<br/>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<br/><br/>Ephes. 4:23<br/>And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;<br/><br/>The Lord is looking for men of God today to &quot;repent&quot;, which means change their way of thinking. When the Apostolic Order of the Kingdom structure embraces your heart and soul, it will forever change you and allow you to &quot;see&quot; the Kingdom the way Jesus Christ always intended. I am still amazed to this day, that a man could have people call him a &quot;Pastor&quot; when the title never existed in the Kingdom of God that Jesus set up. Men preach from pulpits weekly that the children of God are to not live on bread alone but on EVERY word that proceeds out of the mouth of God (His Holy Word). Yet they themselves carry titles and a name that was never recorded! These issues are truly worth taking heed to Saints. As Paul said to the Galatians:<br/><br/>Galatians 1:6-7<br/>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: [7] Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.<br/><br/>Galatians 3:1-3<br/>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? [2] This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? [3] Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?<br/><br/>When Paul first began his work with these people, he brought in the Kingdom of God in Spirit and truth. With the mantle and anointing of Apostolic Ministry, he built, labored and dug a spiritual foundation among them, which INCLUDED the appointing of ELDERS (plural) in the local church (singular). Upon his departure though, men came in with &quot;other&quot; teachings and saints this is very important to see and understand. It was ALWAYS upon his departure that false doctrines crept in and took disciples away in error. For this cause he wrote that he marveled that they were so soon REMOVED unto ANOTHER Gospel. The word another here means--&quot;Strange, ALTERED, different&quot;.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Acts 20:26-31<br/>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. [27] For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. [28] Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. [29] For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. [30] Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. [31]<br/>

			<img style="float: right;  margin: 10px;" src="img/ark1.png"/>

			<br/><br/>Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.<br/><br/>Now please think about this with a reverence for the Almighty God today. Men came in with a Strange and ALTERED Gospel, which was NOT the Gospel that Paul had preached to them.<br/><br/>2 Cor. 11:4<br/>For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.<br/><br/>The exact thing he feared would happen to the saints in Corinth also happened in the regions of Galatia. What did this Gospel eventually do to them which had once begun in Spirit? It slowly transformed them back in the flesh and they were BLINDED to this and never knew. In time, the man they once LOVED so much--Paul, became their enemy and they turned on him--how tragic and sad!!<br/><br/>Galatians 4:15-16<br/>Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye <br/>would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me. [16] Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?<br/><br/>I can sit here this day and share from my own heart and hurts and pains of just how many over the years once walked with me in love and joy, yet to this day have turned their hearts away. When people begin to listen to OTHER voices, they forget the voice of those set over them in the Lord and whereas they once loved, they now think you are against them. Always remember saints, it is those in &quot;darkness&quot; who do not see. Therefore, they do not see the darkness they are in.<br/><br/>Luke 11:34-35<br/>The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. [35] Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.<br/><br/><br/>Let your EYE be single on the Kingdom of God and Jesus Christ and not the doctrines of men. May Jesus Christ not be just some head belief you have in him, but truly living in your presence with all power and authority.<br/><br/>1 Peter 2:25<br/>For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your <br/>souls.<br/><br/>THIS is why &quot;BISHOP MINISTRY&quot; and its end result is to bring a zealousness to repentance (changing your way of thinking). For those who truly have a pure heart for God, they will gladly receive correction. Again, remember the scriptures that speak so boldly, yet are rarely heard this day and age:<br/><br/>1 Thes. 5:12-13<br/>And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the <br/>Lord, and admonish you; [13] And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.<br/><br/>The word &quot;over&quot; here means to be set in rank or to preside over. You are called to esteem them highly in love for their work's sake? What work? The daily praying, laboring and leading and overseeing they do for your protection!! Think about it. What father really takes great laughter and joy in the disciplining of his child with the ROD? It breaks my heart and hurts me whenever I have had to give my lovely daughter the Rod. I do it though because I am commanded by God and in obedience, I know it will work in the heart of my daughter the peaceful fruits of righteousness. It is not pleasant to administer, but the end result is precious. How much more does it hurt for Elders to have to &quot;Bishop&quot; and discipline the unruly souls of the saints? I take no pleasure in doing it, but IF, IF, IF, IF the heart of the one being disciplined is right with God, he will receive the chastisement and correction. THIS is why for an Elders &quot;work's&quot; sake you are to esteem them <br/>highly in love!! It is difficult, but nonetheless necessary.<br/><br/>The scriptures warn us that any man that will NOT endure chastening or rebuke or correction is a bastard in the sight of God. This is one who does NOT know their father. They know they HAVE a father, but they do NOT know him. This is much like the Pharisees who KNEW they had a father God, but did NOT know Father God and thus Jesus (God in the flesh) told them their father was the devil. For this cause they had him beaten and crucified!! This is what some do today in the realm of the unseen spiritual world when they rebuke their Elders or overseers by saying they know more or who are we to speak what we do.<br/><br/>Hebrews 12:6-9<br/>For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. [7] If ye <br/>endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? [8] But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. [9] Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?<br/><br/>Notice how he says you are bastards and NOT sons. It is because many proclaim to be &quot;sons&quot; of God today, but they are not true sons. Read Romans 9 &amp; 10. The word bastard here:<br/><br/>nothos, Greek 3541, Strong&#x2019;s nothos, noth'-os; of uncertain affinity; a spurious or illegitimate son bastard.<br/><br/>A spurious son is one who rejects, does not receive and retaliates against. They are illegitimate sons.<br/><br/>Several years ago a man came to me and told me he had a $12,000 check for our World Outreach Ministry. In heart I rejoiced for I knew just what this would do to so many I travel to and work with in the deep regions of poverty and despair. That week, I found out from his wife that there were some problems in his home that he was not dealing with properly and it was causing spiritual breakdowns there. I sat in his home with he and his wife and I brought forth the Bishop Ministry to his soul, IN LOVE, and shared with him what he needed to do to make things right. This was an offense to his soul. He rebuked his wife for ever coming to her Elder and letting his sin be known because he himself would not deal with it. She had every God given right by our Father in Heaven to come to me. In his rebellion to the Word of God, he left the church and never came back. Now, as an Elder in the faith, it was NOT his money that made me his friend and it was NOT his money that made me want to placate his soul. It was HIS soul that was in need of correction for his walk <br/>with God to be righteous and I did what God called me to do. I speak this for this cause. I will never allow money to persuade me as a man of God to do my duty to bring correction. This is why I have never looked at the records in our Body here to see who tithes and how much. The only amount of money that I am personally aware of is that which comes into the World Outreach Ministry. I will answer to God one day and a man's money means nothing with God. It is all going to burn when the judgment day arrives anyway. Would the $12,000 have been a blessing? My Lord yes. But what would have been an even greater blessing? That this man would have received correction, repented and made things right with God, his wife and family.<br/><br/>The Bishop Ministry deals with many issues in life. It brings authority, correction and rebuke:<br/><br/>2 Tim. 3:16-17<br/>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: [17] That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.<br/><br/>2 Tim. 4:1-3<br/>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; [2] Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. [3] For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;<br/><br/>We live in an hour saints when many are taught without oversight, correction or rebuke. They feel they can go their own way, do their own thing and do GOOD works for Jesus, when the whole time they are in subjection to no authority. Please, know this. ALL will say they are under authority. Do you know just how many over the years who have asked me to take oversight or say they submit? Then when they hear something they do not LIKE, that is when the true soul manifests. They are loose cannons and they are truly doing more harm than blessing for Jesus in this earth. Men without correction, without oversight, without authority, without having to answer to NO ONE! That is a dangerous person today.<br/><br/>Hebrews 13:7<br/>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: <br/>whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.<br/><br/>Hebrews 13:17<br/>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.<br/><br/>Once again notice these two scriptures. The first tells you to follow their faith, NOT their flesh. All have sinned and come short of the glory of God. Paul called himself &quot;Chief&quot; amongst sinners, yet was used by God to bring us over one half of the New Testament. I am a man who has sinned and come short of God's glory every day. HE is removing the leprosy though from my heart daily in my walk with him. That has nothing to do though with the authority God gives me to take oversight to this body. You are called to follow their faith. Also, it states that you are to submit yourselves because they answer for your SOULS. It can also be unprofitable to you if you despise this. This is the Bishop Ministry saints.<br/><br/>Since when did God ever ordain the structure for you to go to church, listen to a Pastor and then go your way during the week? That whole structure is man-made. The fact is the church is a people, not a building. A Pastor does not exist, and you are to live daily with the study of the Bible in your OWN life to hear HIS voice and be taught by the HOLY SPIRIT. You are to be in subjection to the authority of a Plurality of Elders in the local assembly, under tutors and governors until the time appointed of a spiritual father (if you are blessed enough to have that revelation)--Gal.4:1-2 Finally you are to obey the oversight given to you by those set over you in the Lord. I still am amazed at how 2 and 3 year old believers rebuke their Elders today with no fear of God. The Bible tells me the Judgment seat is coming, not Joyful Seat!!<br/><br/>I pray that now you are beginning to see a little of the Government of God. This teaching so far has only dealt with foundations in that area to show you &quot;Bishop Ministry&quot;. There is much more in the Government of God teaching. When so many big named men today are carrying this title, (Bishop Such and Such) the Holy Spirit of God would desire to once again protect us from false doctrine and false representations of Jesus. Again, remember the scriptures of those who will come preaching ANOTHER Jesus and ANOTHER Spirit and ANOTHER Gospel. (II Cor.11:1-17) It may all sound so good, but is it the Kingdom?<br/><br/>With the teaching on &quot;BISHOP MINISTRY&quot;, let us once again go to the Holy Scriptures to PROVE all things. I truly pray with all my heart that you are taking this to the Word of God and sitting back to meditate upon this. In so doing, you WILL begin to see the difference between the Kingdom of God and &quot;Christianity&quot;. Again, please know that I condemn no man for being in these situations or titles. My prayer is for TRUE men of God to see truth, humble themselves and repent (change their way of thinking). Of course, this teaching is not a pleasant one to many for in their highmindedness, they will not come down from building their Kingdoms and wanting power before the people. That is sad, but for many true. Jesus is looking for men today that will humble themselves and speak truth to the people and feed them and take oversight to them HIS way and not theirs.<br/><br/>I sat in London on my way to Kenya several years ago. I met with a man named Ray McCauley and his wife who were the &quot;Pastors&quot; of Rhema Bible Church in South Africa. AS I was heading into the bush of Africa, they were heading to Campmeeting&quot; in Tulsa. Ray was going to speak that night with some of the Anglican Church of England leaders (Very much structured like Roman Catholicism). I asked if I could pray for him before his meeting and I prayed for boldness and strength that he would preach the power of salvation and redemption and bring in the Kingdom of God to these men of religion. When I was done praying, he looked at me and said, &quot;I am not going to cause waves tonight or bring in any trouble&quot;. I said, then for what purpose are you going? Did not Jesus stir up all those around him with the preaching of the Kingdom? Did not Paul say in Gal.1:10 that the day he pleases men is the day he should NOT be the servant of Christ? This did not go over well.<br/><br/>I then had some time to sit with Ray the next day. He was quite angered with me because his wife told him the night before how I shared with her that she was not a Pastor according to the Word of God. I did not do this to put her down, but to teach truth and bring the Word of God into proper alignment. Remember saints that we are to prove all things. If this woman was going to rebuke me, then she must correct me by the scriptures, but they never can. Thus, their doctrine is NOT Sound Doctrine and it leads many astray. Anyway, that day I sat with Ray and showed him in the Word of God the nine requirements Jesus gave for Discipleship and then I showed him the three year process of this in training men up. I talked about the Government of God, Elders and Deacons (not ushers) and soon he just got up and walked out of the room. He came back in with a cup of coffee and said, &quot;How many to you have in your church, Kim&quot;. I told Ray that Jesus built the Kingdom on the 12, not the 5,000 and that we had 120 just like Pentacost. He then said, &quot;Well, when you get 10,000 people like I have, then come back and talk to be about discipleship&quot;!!! He then walked out of the room. This is the sadness saints of what is out there today in the name of Jesus. Their success is built on numbers, money and fame. Always remember this. The MORE Jesus preached the Kingdom, the FEWER followed him!! Read your Bibles!!<br/><br/>I only shared this for the cause of stating that most men in authority today live under their own authority. They are not willing to change even IF they are shown the Word of God. It is rare for men to repent (change their way of thinking) once they embrace the Kingdom of God. Very few men will do this. Apollos was such a man that DID do this in the Word of God. Let's take a look.<br/><br/>Acts 18:24-26<br/>And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. [25] This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. [26] And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.<br/>

			<img style="float: left;  margin: 10px;" src="img/ark2.png"/>

			<br/>Notice the words that described this preacher in Ephesus!!! Eloquent, Mighty, Instructed, Fervent, Taught Diligently. There is ONE interesting thing mentioned though that is never spoken much of. He knew ONLY the Baptism of John. Why would this even be put into the scriptures? Well, when a disciple is taught the Oracles of God, which God says you must know before you can even be mature and a teacher of the Word, (Heb.5--I Peter 4) you come to know about that there are seven baptisms in the New Testament. Apollos, at this time in his life, knew only one. Therefore, his preaching and teaching was very, very, very limited. Since Aquila and Priscilla had lived with Paul in Corinth for one and one half years, they constantly day and night were in subjection to the Apostolic Mantle and anointing. They were thus able the HEAR this man preach and they knew exactly what was needed to bring the Kingdom of God to him in a more STRAIGHT way. The great thing is that Apollos was humbled and listened and sat under their tutorage until an appointed time.<br/><br/>Today, many men have this &quot;ANOTHER&quot; Jesus they preach and it fills the world with the flesh. Jesus said that many would come in the last days, saying HE (Jesus) was Christ, but HE then said be not DECEIVED. Just because men are preaching that Jesus is Christ, does not mean they preach the Kingdom of God. For this cause, Elders who rule well and have effective oversight, PROTECT you from the doctrines of devils, wolves in sheeps clothing who come as false prophets and from false teachers who bring doctrines of men and not the Kingdom of God. Wherever you are in your life with Jesus Christ, PLEASE be students of the Word of God and measure all things by the scriptures. Just because something seems so, so, so, so GOOD, it does not mean it is LIFE!!! In the Kingdom of God, NO MAN is ever lifted up, looked up to or exalted. No man has a name, ministry, reputation or TITLE. Please saints, study the Word of God and let no man rule your spirituality.<br/><br/>To this day, I am called by my name by all the saints at New Covenant, the brethren in the Philippines and Kenya Africa and Uganda. Some call me Brother Kim at times, that is fine. My name though is Kim, I am their brother and thus they call me Kim. Did Paul ever ask, or Peter ask or James ask or John ask for men to call them by a title? ABSOLUTELY NOT!!<br/><br/>Did these humble and faithful servants of God in all righteousness EVER put their own personal names on a ministry? ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!! God never ordained INDEPENDENT ministries. The Apostolic ministry was the SENT ONES, they went out, spied out, preached salvation and redemption, made disciples, ordained Elders to feed and take oversight, then they went on elsewhere. They always returned back though to that place where they had their &quot;Seal of Apostleship&quot;--I Cor.9 They were men of NO REPUTATION, just like the Lord Jesus Christ who is the head of his body. In the local body, there is to be a plurality of Elders and it is the anointings and spiritual mantles of the Apostolic, Prophetic, Evangelistic, Shepherd and Teachers that were given to the SAINTS to perfect you to do the work of ministry. No where recorded did men have their own ministries, traveling on the circuit from place to place and building reputations. This is <br/>what gives so many today the false representation of what the Kingdom of God is all about.<br/><br/>Philip. 2:5-7<br/>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: [6] Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: [7] But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:<br/><br/>Sadly today, especially in the Word of Faith movement, powerful men with multi-million dollar ministries proclaim Jesus has made them rich. Sorry folks, but you made them rich by giving to &quot;their ministries&quot;. They put their personal names on their ministries, travel the world in glamour, prostitute and sell the gospel, all to get their names in Charisma Magazine and become the next hottest kid on the block. (Please note: Nothing wrong with Charisma Magazine, but how ministries try to sell themselves in it to build reputations. This is heady, haughty and high-minded!! In a recent Interview on TV, Benny Hinn was asked why he privately hired out the Concorde Supersonic Jet to fly with his men to London for meetings? The cost by the way was $100,000 to do this. On top of that, he was asked why they stayed in the Penthouse, were privately catered to and why did he have paid Bodyguards? Is this Jesus Christ saints? Is this the Kingdom of God? Granted, God said he would bless his children and even give some men an ability that they may be rich, but only for God's purpose should this be. Hallelujah.<br/><br/>1 Tim. 4:1-2<br/>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; [2] Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;<br/><br/>2 Tim. 3:1<br/>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.<br/><br/>2 Tim. 3:4-5<br/>Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; [5] Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.<br/><br/>Did you know saints that Paul NEVER took ONE DINARIE or ONE PENNY out of a city? Did you know that Paul never preached for a LOVE OFFERING? Did you know Paul only gave and spent for the sake of people. I am grieved when I come from the Philippines or Kenya Africa and know that these so called men of God have gone and raped these people financially all for the sake of false doctrine. I have tried to restore many hearts in these poor nations of people who once sought out God, but were turned sour in heart when the false promises of these men never paid off. One man from Nakuru Kenya told me how he went to a Morris Cerrillo crusade in Nairobi. The man preached that if all there would empty their pockets and give to his ministry they would all be blessed and given back 100 fold what they sowed. This by the way is a lie of the devil saints and scriptures are grossly twisted by these false teachers. This man, like SO many I have met, did just that. From that time, he went hungry, had no way back home to his family by travel, which was over two hours away by vehicle. Lost every schilling he had and to this day never turned his heart toward God again. He was told one thing, ignorantly believed it and ended up in the ditch. Of course, I know God blesses us saints, but he never taught us he would make us all rich in money. Spiritually with wisdom and knowledge and understanding---yes!!!, but not in money.<br/><br/>If their 100 fold principle really worked, then why do they not mail money to you and everyone on their mailing lists so they can reap back this teaching? Sadly they get richer everyday, people get poorer some times and they will never know you or your plight. Stay focused saints on the Word of God. They preach their gifts, exalt their ministries and fill their pockets with the only money some of these have. This is the dangerous Gospel of America and we all see it and are exposed to it and many believe it because that is the only Gospel they know. Sadly, this is &quot;another gospel&quot;. Go to the third nations of the world, into the bush where poverty, sickness, disease and hunger kill and then come home to America. You will truly have eyes opened to a life outside of what we gloat in here. I will leave this area for now, because it grieves me and maybe another time I will deal with this false merchandising in the last days.<br/><br/>2 Peter 2:1-3<br/>But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers <br/>among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. [2] And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. [3] And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.<br/><br/>What they preach breeds a spirit of covetousness and this is why so many today are not satisfied with what they have but always want more! The word &quot;denying&quot; above means to contradict. In other words, what they preach really CONTRADICTS what the true scriptures say.<br/><br/>Let us continue with &quot; BISHOP MINISTRY&quot; now and see again how and where we have erred so much from the way it was in the beginning of Church History in the Book of Acts. Listen carefully again. One great area that is truly missing today is DISCIPLESHIP. Men and women get saved, go to Bible Colleges, graduate and become ordained as Pastors etc. This is so sad in the sight of God. Jesus commanded us to go to the nations and MAKE DISCIPLES&#x2014;Mt.28<br/><br/>Most that come OUT of Bible Colleges today, come out after having studied and read hundreds of books sometimes, and never really study the Bible. My Brother went to Rhema Bible Training Center in Tulsa Oklahoma for two years back in 1980-82, I went to visit him twice each summer while he attended. I noticed that he never studied his Bible but only read Kenneth Hagin books. I asked him one time, why. He was required as a student at Rhema to buy the complete library of Kenneth Hagin and they had to read and study and take tests on this mans books. For this cause, thousands graduate each year totally programmed to Word of Faith Doctrine and never come to know the depth of the Word of God or the Kingdom of God. Prosperity and Positive Confession is their everything. These doctrines are dangerous. (Once again, nothing against these men, but rather where we have erred in getting our eyes on flesh and blood and NOT Jesus Christ.)<br/>

He was 31 years old and already on his third church Pastoring. He could not understand how I could keep the attention of the saints in the House of God here for more than 20-25 minutes with preaching. I told him how we never get anything less than one hour of pure Word during each gathering. At least an hour minimum. Of course, he was voted out by Deacon Boards which are big in the Assemblies of God, but once again this is pure religion. He shared how he went to the Assemblies of God seminary &quot;Northwestern&quot; I believe in St. Paul. He studied there for five years and as God is my witness, told me he never studied his Bible because he did NOT HAVE TIME!! He had to read hundreds and hundreds of books over those years all written by men.<br/><br/>Many of you remember Jim and Tammi Faye Bakker? After the PTL scandal when Jim went to prison, once released he was on the Larry King Live show. When Larry King asked Jim Bakker what changed his life after the breakdown, he literally said on nationwide TV, &quot;Larry, when I went into Prison I was a broken man. For the first time I really started reading my BIBLE, oh, I could quote scriptures here and there, but never really knew the Bible. Can you imagine.? This man had a multi-million dollar ministry, world wide TV ministry and was an Assemblies of God preacher from Minnesota telling people they needed to be Born-Again, but he never really studied the Word of God. This is what is out there today saints. Men programmed by man made structures. They learn of men, study men and preach like men. May the Word of God become your source of truth in life. This is what Paul said;<br/><br/>Galatians 1:10-12<br/>For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. [11] But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. [12] For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>Think on this one for a moment!!! Paul knew the real teacher&#x2014;The Holy Spirit.<br/><br/>Again, I condemn no man, but rather expose truth that we all would be protected. The Bible says that men must have at least THREE years of discipleship in their lives BEFORE they even begin to understand Kingdom Principles. Today, almost all who get out of these Bible Schools, step right into ministry and NEVER even entered into the ministry or Office of the Deacon. In the Word of God, no man can even be involved in Eldership Rule unless he has gone through the office of the Deacon. They all want to be leaders without ever learning what it is to serve as a Deacon. Jesus does not make leaders, he makes SERVANTS. A servant, becomes a leader in the eyes of Jesus. More on that later. Just know that today our churches are filled with USHERS, when the Kingdom Structure was Deacons. Some Churches have Deacon Boards, when the Office of the Deacon is of Descension Order and the ministry of HELPS, NOT GOVERNMENTS!!!<br/><br/>The only book in the whole old Testament that used the word Disciple, was the Book of Isaiah. It is 66 chapters long, and there are 66 Books in the Bible. It begins with the fall of man and sin in Chapter one and ends with the New Heaven and New Earth in Chapter 66. It is complete in the prophetic word concerning the Kingdom of God. In this Book and only this book, you find the word disciple in the Old Testament.<br/><br/>Isaiah 8:16<br/>Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.<br/><br/>Isaiah 20:2-3<br/>At the same time spake the Lord by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth <br/>from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot. [3] And the Lord said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia;<br/><br/>Notice HOW long Isaiah was naked (humbled) and barefoot---THREE YEARS.<br/><br/>Jesus Christ spent THREE YEARS raising, training, teaching, equipping and preparing his disciples to be ready to effectively serve and lead in HIS Kingdom Order.<br/><br/>Once Saul of Tarsus got saved in Acts 9 (later became Paul), he went into the Arabian desert experience of his life for THREE YEARS of discipleship before returning to Jerusalem. In fact, THREE YEARS go by between two scriptures in Acts 9:25-26<br/><br/>Acts 9:25-26<br/>Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket. [26] And when <br/>Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of <br/>him, and believed not that he was a disciple.<br/><br/>Notice how in verse 25 he was lowered over the wall to escape the plot of the Jews to kill him and in verse 26 he came to Jerusalem. Now, THREE YEARS go by during these two verses. How do we know this? By the Word of God. In Galatians 1, when Paul was sharing with the saints about his conversion (He is an Apostle now, which took 17 years after conversion before he was ordained for this) He tells them how he went to Jerusalem AFTER THREE YEARS.<br/><br/>Galatians 1:16-18<br/>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred <br/>not with flesh and blood: [17] Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before <br/>me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. [18] Then after three years I went <br/>up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.<br/><br/>Sadly today, many believe that Paul got saved and immediately became a preacher. That is not true and totally goes against the Word of God. He fulfilled scripture in his own discipleship. Finally, once Paul was now a Spiritual father and walking in the Apostolic anointing, he fathered and raised men for THREE YEARS to help establish them as Elders in the faith.<br/><br/><br/>Acts 20:17<br/>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.<br/><br/>Acts 20:26<br/>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.<br/><br/>Acts 20:31<br/>Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. <br/><br/>Are ALL these examples of THREE YEARS coincidence? Absolutely not. Think about it. Today, very few are discipled in the Word of God, and most ministers today do not even know the ORACLES OF GOD, which the scriptures say they are babies spiritually if they do not know these.<br/><br/>Hebrews 5:12-13<br/>For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be <br/>the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of <br/>strong meat. [13] For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.<br/><br/>Are you being taught the Oracles of God by your Elders? I would pray so, for if not you will never come into spiritual maturity. It is not HOW LONG a man says he has been Born-Again that makes him spiritual, but what he has been taught and lives.<br/>

			<br/>Thus you can see now again why so much is missing in the Government of God and why so few people are in subjection to true authority and why so many men of God do not even know what BISHOP MINISTRY is. This is sad and we are producing many who profess to know God, but deny him in their actions and deeds. This is why the VERY FIRST DOCTRINE of Christ is &quot;Repentance from DEAD Works&quot;.<br/><br/>The BISHOP MINISTRY is a God given anointing to Elders in the faith to watch over and protect the Body of Christ. This anointing brings great confrontations at times because those with undealt with souls do not want to submit to any authority but their OWN. This is dangerous and leaves men in positions of being &quot;illegitimate sons&quot;. Remember the &quot;bastards&quot; of Hebrews 12?<br/><br/>Hebrews 12:7-8<br/>If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father <br/>chasteneth not? [8] But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye <br/>bastards, and not sons.<br/><br/>nothos, Greek 3541, Strong&#x2019;s nothos, noth'-os; of uncertain affinity; a spurious or illegitimate son bastard.<br/><br/>The BISHOP MINISTRY takes us into another ministry Jesus taught about the PORTER.<br/><br/>Mark 13:34-37<br/>For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his <br/>servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. [35] Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: [36] Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. [37] And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.<br/><br/>When men of God walk as Elders in the faith to teach, train, prepare and equip the saints in discipleship, they do this through the Apostolic, Prophetic, Evangelistic, Shepherd and Teacher mantles to fully mature you for the Kingdom of God in this earth. In so doing, they represent an Authority that is God-given and they give their lives for the saints to make sure the saints live holy, godly and righteous lives as well as protect them from the wolves in sheep&#x2019;s clothing. They take oversight to the soul man and keep you in checks and balances spiritually as you mature and grow. Satan wants to take you as far off course as he can to deceive you, but Elders in the faith watch for this and protect you with God given intuitiveness to watch over your soul. Once a man gets saved, he is called to be discipled and begin his journey of crucifying the flesh, being broken and emptied out for the sake of decreasing that the life of the Lord Jesus may increase within him or her. The first three years are only for the sake of crucifying the flesh. This is why so MUCH EMPHASIS is placed by the Word of God on those three years of discipleship.<br/><br/>Leviticus 19:23-25<br/>And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then <br/>ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: <br/>it shall not be eaten of. [24] But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the <br/>Lord withal. [25] And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the <br/>increase thereof: I the Lord your God.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful shadow and type of us being trees of righteousness and bearing fruit. The first THREE YEARS of what you have is uncircumcised, which means your flesh still remains active and present. IN the fourth year one begins to truly know how to sense in spirit and truth and really praise the Lord and in the fifth year your fruit is ready to be eaten by others as you see the increase of the Lord your God. As it is naturally so it is spiritually. Ever wonder why children do not go to Kindergarten until the fifth year of age? Thank about that one.<br/><br/>Thus saints, The BISHOP MINISTRY is truly lacking today. Many men will not even desire to bring <br/>discipline or correction to the saints for they fear upsetting them and losing them. If the saints leave, then the tithes decrease and the kingdom they build will crumble. In the meantime, people go unchecked, can live any way they feel is right and many stand without correction or in subjection to authority. They stay in a House of God only for as long as they see fit and then desire to move on. This violates the Baptism into the Body which is one of the seven baptisms in the New Testament and again is one of the Doctrine of Christ. It is the Elders who will answer for your SOULS on that day of judgment and this is why BISHOP MINISTRY touches the soul man and brings him into subjection to the Word of God. This usually brings confrontation.<br/><br/>For this cause, we truly are lacking today in the power and authority of Kingdom Structure. Very few grow up in the fear and reverence of the HOLY and living God. People do whatever they feel is right and will not listen to wise counsel. Many compromise the Word of God all in the name of Jesus. They come and go and never refrain their feet. Many live in Moab today and think they live in the light. For this cause, men of God are called to BISHOP the souls of the flock and bring them into subjection to HIS Authority.<br/><br/>1 Peter 5:2<br/>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;<br/><br/>episkopeo, Greek 1983, Strong&#x2019;s episkopeo, ep-ee-skop-eh'-o; from Greek 1909 (epi) and Greek <br/>4648 (skopeo); to oversee; by implication to beware :- look diligently, take the oversight.<br/><br/>Acts 20:28-29<br/>Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. [29] For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.<br/><br/>Philip. 1:1<br/>Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:<br/><br/>1 Tim. 3:2<br/>A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;<br/><br/>Titus 1:7<br/>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;<br/><br/>1 Peter 2:25<br/>For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your <br/>souls.<br/>

			<br/>episkopos, Greek 1985, Strong&#x2019;s episkopos, ep-is'-kop-os; from Greek 1909 (epi) and Greek 4649 (skopos) (in the sense of Greek 1983 (episkopeo)); a superintendent, i.e. Christian officer in general charge of a (or the) church (literal or figurative) :- bishop, overseer<br/><br/>Remember now that BISHOP MINISTRY is not a man, not a name, not a TITLE, not a position, but rather a function of Elders who are given the right by God to administer correction and take oversight. This is a God given gift and not man aspired or man attained. You are either called by God or you are not. No Bible school in the World can anoint you or make you an Elder. They can disciple you to learn to serve the Lord Jesus Christ, but we truly need the Spirit of God today to bring back the discipline and authority of Jesus Christ in this earth.<br/><br/>As we close, give thought to this:<br/><br/>Luke 7:7-9<br/>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed. [8] For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. [9] When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.<br/><br/>Many preach today that when a man has positive confession he has great faith because the Centurion told Jesus to just &quot;speak in a word&quot; and my servant will be healed. The real issue here is this. ONCE this man recognized AUTHORITY and knew Jesus was under it and he himself was under it (Caesar), THIS is when Jesus marvelled. This Centurion spoke authority and Jesus said---FAITH!!<br/><br/>I would pray that we would be thankful to the Lord for having men of God take the oversight to our lives with care and protection. Praise the Lord for the ROD of Authority and correction given when needed. I pray you were blessed and that you continue to study the Word of God. I will share more soon. May we all remember the words of Our Lord Jesus Christ in this day. The last days will bring very perilous times, not revivals. Men will fall FROM the faith, not be added by millions. Seducing Spirits and Doctrines of Devils will come and men will no longer hearken to Sound Doctrine. Jesus said, &quot;Will I find faith in the earth when I return&quot;. Faith only comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. Mens hearts will wax worse and worse and the love of many will grow cold. What is LOVE?<br/><br/>1 John 5:2-3<br/>By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. [3] For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.<br/><br/>2 John 1:6<br/>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.<br/><br/>John 14:15<br/>If ye love me, keep my commandments.<br/><br/>THUS; in the last days the love of many will grow cold. The lack of obedience to the Word of God will permeate the world and the lives of many professing to know Jesus. The Word speaks for itself. They that endure to the end shall be saved. Fight the good fight of faith saints. Be blessed when men love you enough to take oversight and bring correction. When you are young in the faith and in the scriptures, you need parental oversight spiritually less you fall and get hurt or be swept away by every wind of doctrine. Thank God for BISHOP MINISTRY.
