		<br/>Hello Saints;<br/><br/>Praise the Living Lord and Glory to our Father on this day. Rise Up!---people of power, Stand Up!--Across the Land and<br/>Take Up!---the sword and the Spirit. Let this day be a victorious day. Let this day be a day of purpose. Look to those around you and what do<br/>you see? Do you see joy, peace, hope, comfort or strength? Remember:<br/><br/>LIGHT:<br/><br/><br/>&quot;Ye are the LIGHT of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men LIGHT a candle, and put it &quot;under&quot; a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth LIGHT unto all that are in the house. Let your LIGHT so shine before men, that they may SEE your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.---Mt.5:14-16<br/><br/>&quot;For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a LIGHT of the gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth&quot;---Acts 13:47<br/><br/>&quot;Be ye not therefore partakers with them. For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye LIGHT in the Lord: walk as children of LIGHT. (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the LIGHT: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee LIGHT&quot;--Eph.5:7-14<br/><br/>&quot;You are children of LIGHT, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness&quot;--I Thess.5:5<br/><br/>&quot;For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. For God, who commanded the LIGHT to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the LIGHT of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.&quot;--II Cor.4:5-7<br/><br/>SALT:<br/><br/><br/>&quot;Ye are the SALT of the earth: but if the SALT have lost his savor, wherewith shall it be SALTED? It is good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.&quot;--Mt.5:13 (In other words, we are to preserve and add taste to life, and NOT be the doormats of the world where men wipe their feet on us)<br/><br/>&quot;For every one shall be SALTED with fire, and every sacrifice shall be SALTED with SALT. SALT is good: but if the SALT have lost his SALTNESS, wherewith will ye season it? Have SALT in yourselves, and have peace one with another.&quot;--Mark 9:49-50<br/><br/>&quot;Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with SALT, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.&quot;--Col.4:5-6<br/><br/><br/>CONQUERORS:<br/><br/>&quot;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long: we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than CONQUERORS through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot;--Romans 8:35-39<br/><br/>&quot;We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.&quot;-II Cor.4:8-11<br/><br/>&quot;And from the days of John the Baptist until now the KINGDOM of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.&quot;--Mt.11:12<br/><br/>May your light shine, your salt preserve and your faith conquer today for the Lord Jesus Christ. Be blessed and remember that you are ambassadors for Christ. You are in a world you are not of. You are of a KINGDOM that is not of this world. Go forth in boldness.<br/>
