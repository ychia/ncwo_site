		Hello Saints of the Most High God;  Praise the Lord and God bless you this day.  I have wanted to write this whole week concerning Halloween, but due to time, busy schedules and all, I did not have that time to do so earlier.  I wanted to once again share with you all that this evening tonight, known as HALLOWEEN, is the most demonic and evil and dark day of the WHOLE calendar year.<br/><br/>This day in the realm of the unseen, in the realm of the Spirit World, is the most dark and vile and wicked and evil of them all.  Today and tonight will be SATAN'S night in this earth as many will die, perish into eternal damnation and MANY will be possessed into the world of the occult.  When SO many laugh, party, joke and think of this day being nothing but INNOCENT FUN, I must beg to differ.  When many are ignorant to spirituals, they have no idea about days or nights like this, only because they have not been taught yet, are not old enough spiritually to discern yet, or plainly rebuke truth and justify their flesh and soul as to why there is nothing wrong with it.<br/><br/>I give thanks to God for the POWER of HIS Word and I give thanks for the revelation of KINGDOM ORDER and principles.  <br/><br/>1 Cor. 12:1 <br/>    Now concerning spiritual, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. <br/><br/>1 Cor. 2:12 <br/>    Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. <br/><br/>This scripture very distinctly teaches us that there IS a spirit in this world.  We know that Satan is the god of this world and he is the prince of the power of the air.  THE spirit that NOW works in the children of disobedience.<br/><br/>Ephes. 2:2 <br/>    Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: <br/><br/>Because of spiritual disobedience to the Word of God, comes the wrath of God upon all who partake and live this way and for this cause, Satan's whole purpose and seduction is to bring disobedience by getting people to do things they THINK are no big deal!!<br/><br/>Ephes. 5:6 <br/>    Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. <br/><br/>2 Cor. 11:14 <br/>    And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. <br/><br/>We are commanded saints IN the Word of God and BY the authority of the Word of God to have NO fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness.  We are commanded to NOT be partakers with them in any way.  We are commanded that we CAN NOT be children of God and drink of the cup of the Lord and then partake and drink of the cup of devils.<br/><br/>Ephes. 5:11-12 <br/>    And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (EXPOSE) them. [12] For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. <br/><br/>Ephes. 5:7-8 <br/>    Be not ye therefore partakers with them. [8] For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: <br/><br/>1 Cor. 10:21 <br/>    Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils. <br/><br/>Therefore, we must all come to once again search the scriptures to SEE whether these things be so and from the scriptures we learn WHY we are not to partake of things with their roots in paganism, evil, occult, darkness and satanic ritualism.  Even for Christians today to change the order of Halloween and churches observe &quot;Hallelujaheen&quot; with children dressed up in Biblical characters, is even more of an abomination to God.  Now, saints there was a day way back in the 1980's, when New Covenant was young and growing.  For our first year of institution and ONLY in our first year, we had a Hallalujaheen Evening.  I myself did this out of ignorance to the Word of God and was doing again all I had been taught over the years and observed in churches.<br/><br/>1 Tim. 1:13 <br/>    Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. <br/><br/>Prior to my conversion in life and truly getting saved, I was raised in &quot;Christianity&quot;.  Yet even being a so called GOOD person and confessing Christian, I partied, drank, smoked, took the Lord's name in vain and lived a good life and fun life but a spiritually dead life.  What I did, I did in ignorance.  Even after getting saved and beginning to grow, I never had tutors and governors and men of God over me who desired to disciple and train.  Therefore, it took many, many hard years of learning things the hard way, yet PURE way of what was right.  The Holy Spirit continued to teach me as I sought the Lord daily with all my heart.<br/><br/>When the day came that I began to continually seek to obey God and learn so much more about being totally obedient, I studied and learned more and more about issues like Halloween, Christmas, Easter, Birthdays and the like.  WHY, WHY, WHY were these things NOT in the Bible, God's Holy Word, when I was taught to OBEY EVERY Word out of HIS mouth?  AS I learned truth, I continued to repent, change my ways of thinking, and asked God for forgiveness to my lack of spiritual insight.<br/><br/>Now, today, still growing and learning, I desire with ALL my heart to spare the souls of confessing Christians by teaching the holiness, obedience and TRUTH as I do all I can to present them as chaste virgins before the Father in Heaven betrothed to HIS Son.  For this cause, I expose the unfruitful works and do all I can to show the SPIRIT behind such things.  For this cause, New Covenant and all involved with her, shall suffer persecution and tribulations and such.  Why?  Because ALL that will live GODLY in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.<br/><br/>2 Tim. 3:12 <br/>    Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. <br/><br/>Let us look to a few scriptures here for a moment concerning those persons who are involved with Occult practices and what the Bible says about them.  Then let us think about Halloween!<br/>

		<br/>Leviticus 19:31 <br/>    Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God. <br/><br/>Leviticus 20:6 <br/>    And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. <br/><br/>2 Chron. 33:6-7 <br/>    And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger. [7] And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: <br/><br/>Is not a pumpkin a carved image?  Not saying this is what was done here, but the principle fact remains truthful to this day.  Think of ALL the churches today that will have carved pumpkins!!  This time of the fall solstice is here.  The time when harvest comes and the time when Saturnalia grows near toward December.  These may not be big or of much knowledge to Christians, but these holy days are very large and big and observed by those in occultic practices.   Death looms this day and night in the realm of the spirit world and the angel of darkness walks through the earth this day.<br/><br/>Look for a moment again at all these scriptures.  They deal with: familiar spirits, wizards, observers of times, witchcraft and enchantments.  Think about Halloween now saints.  Is this holiday totally absorbed and built upon such?  Ghosts, goblins, skeletons, skulls, darkness, evil, spiders, cobwebs, jack-o-lanterns  (carved pumpkins and lit).  Masks, capes?<br/><br/>Acts 8:9 <br/>    But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: <br/><br/>Jeremiah 27:9 <br/>    Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: <br/><br/>Daniel 2:2 <br/>    Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. <br/><br/>Rev. 22:15 <br/>    For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie. <br/><br/>Think again about Halloween!   Sorcerers will go to the lake of fire. Do you allow your children to watch occultic &quot;family&quot; movies and videos? Do you let them read such books? You are selling your own child into the hand of the devil.  Harry Potter, the Exorcist, etc. they all deal with the occult. Witches, wizards, warlocks, spells, magic, astrology, horoscope, zodiac, psychic hotline, numerology, familiar spirits, etc. all deal with the occult. All that intercourse with and traffick in these things will go to hell. <br/><br/>Rev. 21:8 <br/>    But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.<br/><br/>The rebellious may say, &quot;But we are not practicing witchcraft,&quot; -- I wouldn't be so sure of that, but I won't argue with you because THE BIBLE SAYS DO NOT EVEN LEARN THE WAYS OF THE HEATHEN--<br/><br/>Jeremiah 10:2 Thus saith the LORD, LEARN NOT THE WAY of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.<br/>The latter part of the above verse speaks to astrology (&quot;astrologer&quot; is a Bible word as are &quot;magician&quot;, &quot;stargazers&quot;, &quot;monthly prognosticators&quot;, etc.). People who claim to the know the Lord (and their children) call 900 numbers, get palms read, etc. They seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter (ref Is 8:19) INSTEAD of living righteously and seeking after God. By their fruits ye shall know them.<br/><br/>I read a wonderful written article recently about where this all came from.  As you know, I write each year to you all concerning this and sharing HOW the Roman Catholic Church took the worship and observance of demonic activities and brought it INTO Christianity all in the changed name of Jesus.  What was a day honored on November 1, each year, to honor death and conjur up dead spirits, became &quot;All Hallowed Day&quot; for the dead.  Satan did this in mockery to &quot;HALLOWED by thy name&quot;.  The Catholic church took this to pray for departed dead souls in pergatory and to remember the dead.  For this cause, even in Catholic nations to this day, they observe a VERY big festival for the DAY OF THE DEAD.  On the Eve before this worshipping of the dead, it became known as &quot;All HALLOWS Eve&quot;, which later became Halloween!<br/><br/>The many customs we have today in relation to Halloween have their origins in the religious practices of the Romans and the Druids, therefore dating back many centuries. The Romans worshiped various gods and on October 31, a special feast was held in honor of Pomona, goddess of the fruit trees. Later, the Druids, an ancient order of Celtic priests in Britain, made this feast an even more extensive celebration by also honoring Samhain, lord of the dead. This was normally done on November 1 and it was therefore decided to conveniently honor both Pomona and Samhain on October 31 and November 1. <br/><br/>These Druids believed that on the night before November 1 (October 31) Samhain called together wicked souls or spirits which had been condemned to live in the bodies of animals during the year which had just transpired. Since they were afraid of these spirits, they chose October 31 as a day to sacrifice to their gods, hoping they would protect them. They really believed that on this day they were surrounded by strange spirits, ghosts, witches, fairies, and elves, who came out to hurt them. In addition to this, they also believed that cats were holy animals, as they considered them to represent people who lived formerly, and as punishment for evil deeds were reincarnated as a cat. All this explains why witches, ghosts, and cats are a part of Halloween today.<br/>TRICK OR TREAT:<br/><br/>The custom of trick-or-treating and the use of &quot;jack-o'-lanterns&quot; comes from Ireland. Hundreds of years ago, Irish farmers went from house to house, begging for food, in the name of their ancient gods, to be used at the village Halloween celebration. They would promise good luck to those who gave them good, and made threats to those who refused to give. They simply told the people, &quot;You treat me, or else I will trick you!&quot; <br/><br/>JACK O LANTERNS (PUMPKINS)<br/><br/>The apparently harmless lightened pumpkin face or &quot;jack-o'-lantern&quot; actually is an old Irish symbol of a damned soul. A man named Jack was supposed to be unable to enter heaven due to his miserliness, and unable to enter hell because he had played practice jokes on the devil. As a result, he was condemned to wander over the earth with his lantern until judgment day (i.e., the end of the world). The Irish were so afraid that they would receive an identical plight, that they began to hollow out pumpkins and place lighted candles inside to scare away evil spirits from their home.<br/><br/>When did the modern Halloween celebration begin? <br/><br/>During the Middle Ages (about 600 years ago), the Roman Catholic Church at that time, decided to make the change-over from pagan religion to Christianity a bit easier, and therefore allowed the new converts to maintain some of their pagan feasts. It was agreed, however, that from now on they would be celebrated as &quot;Christian&quot; feasts. So instead of praying to their heathen gods, they would now pray to, and remember the deaths of saints. For this reason the church decided to call November 1 the &quot;Day of All Saints,&quot; and the mass to be celebrated on that day &quot;Alhallowmass.&quot; In consequence of this, the evening prior to this day was named, &quot;All Hallowed Evening&quot; which subsequently was abbreviated as &quot;Halloween.&quot; In spite of this effort to make October 31 a &quot;holy evening,&quot; all the old customs continued to be practiced, and made this evening anything BUT a holy evening! <br/><br/>HALLOWEEN TODAY<br/><br/>You would have to agree with me that also today Halloween is most definetly not a holy evening!! This annual event is far from the harmless, innocent tradition it is promoted to be. Many dread this &quot;holy&quot; evening as they think what could happen to them, their property, and/or their children! Consistent with its historical roots, this evening is characterized by fear, and frequently arouses dormant fears in many. The fear generated by this event is symbolic of the fear which plagues so many in our modern, morally bankrupt world. It is a gripping fear for an unknown and very threatening future, a fear caused by a gnawing inner emptiness. <br/><br/>WHERE DID HALLOWEEN COME FROM?<br/><br/>HALLOWEEN: A CELBRATION FOR SATANISTS, WITCHES, AND CATHOLICS - NOT FUNDAMENTAL CHRISTIANS!<br/>A Roman Catholic website briefly describes the meaning of Halloween to modern Catholics:<br/><br/>&quot;Halloween (the 'e'en' or evening before 'All Hallow's,' or all the 'Holy Ones,' the saints) is the vigil of two feast days. All Saints Day is November 1, and All Souls Day is November 2....On All Saints we celebrate the lives of the saints, especially those in heaven. On All Souls Day we remember those who have died, especially in our immediate family....Skeletons and skulls are naturally symbols at Halloween because of All Souls Day, 'the Day of the Dead,' as some countries call it. It doesn't hurt us to think about death once a year. We're all going to die someday. Skeletons and skulls remind us of this. Figures of devils and witches can also remind us of the ever-present temptation to be like God. Halloween is not 'of the devil,' as some FUNDAMENTALISTS say. Many denominations don't teach about the COMMUNION OF SAINTS, so naturally they don't celebrate All Saints Day or All Souls Day. All they have left of Halloween is pre-Christian superstition about the dead.&quot; (Americancatholic.org)<br/><br/>The same website also describes the ORIGINS of Halloween:<br/><br/>&quot;The true origins of Halloween lie with the ancient Celtic tribes who lived in Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Brittany. For the Celts, November 1 marked the beginning of a new year and the coming of winter. The night before the new year, they celebrated the festival of Samhain, Lord of the Dead. During this festival, Celts believed the souls of the dead -including ghosts, goblins and witches - returned to mingle with the living. In order to scare away the evil spirits, people would wear masks and light bonfires. When the Romans conquered the Celts, they added their own touches to the Samhain festival, such as making centerpieces out of apples and nuts for Pomona, the Roman goddess of the orchards. The Romans also bobbed for apples and drank cider - traditions which may sound familiar to you. But where does the Christian aspect of the holiday come into play? In 835, Pope Gregory IV moved the celebration for all the martyrs (later all saints) from May 13 to November 1. The night before became known as All Hallow's Even or 'holy evening.' Eventually the name was shortened to the current Halloween. On November 2, the Church celebrates All Souls Day. The purpose of these feasts is to remember those who have died, whether they are officially recognized by the Church as saints or not. It is a celebration of the 'communion of saints,' which reminds us that the Church is not bound by space or time. The Catechism of the Catholic Church says that through the communion of saints 'a perennial link of charity exists between the faithful who have already reached their heavenly home, those who are expiating their sins in purgatory and those who are still pilgrims on earth. Between them there is, too, an abundant exchange of all good things.' (#1475).&quot; (AmericanCatholic.org)<br/><br/>Finally, this same website also reveals Halloween's relatively recent birth in the U.S.:<br/>

		<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 200px;">
			<p>
			Rev. 21:8<br/> 
			But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.</p>

		<br/>&quot;...the current custom of going door-to-door to collect treats actually started in Ireland hundreds of years ago...When an influx of Irish Catholic immigrants came to the United States in the 1800s, the custom of trick-or-treating came with them. Does your family carve a pumpkin to place on your porch for Halloween? If so, then you can once again thank the Irish for the tradition. Actually, the custom began with a turnip. People would hollow out the turnips and place lighted candles inside to scare off the evil spirits. When the Irish came to America, they discovered the pumpkin as a larger substitute for the turnip. And so, we now carve pumpkins instead of turnips for Halloween.&quot; (AmericanCatholic.org)<br/><br/>Indeed, Halloween was not popular in the U.S. until the 20th century, when it spread from the Irish Catholic settlements, and was later re-energized by the Wiccans. There is much common ground between Catholics and pagans, especially concerning the dead. As America grows increasingly Catholic and pagan (with the aid of the federal government through public education, etc.), it is no wonder that Halloween is increasingly growing in popularity. Paganism went mainstream in America in 1979 when two books (i.e. ''The Spiral Dance: A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess'' by Starhawk, and ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today'' by Margot Adler) were both released on Halloween. The Harry Potter movement is insuring that the children are not left out of this &quot;new age.&quot;<br/><br/>While Catholics are busy praying for, and TO, dead people, and the pagans are likewise communing with their dead ancestors (not to mention the modern, Druid sacrifices of some serious Satanic groups), Halloween is obviously a night when the devils will run wild! One pagan witch describes the importance of Halloween for communicating with the dead (i.e. &quot;the communion of saints&quot;):<br/><br/>&quot;'There is a recognition of our close ties with our ancestors and a recognition that the veils between the worlds are thin at this time of year.&quot; (Chapin-Bishop, WiccaNet.org)<br/><br/>On Halloween, Pagans will usually prepare a meal and set plates for dead relatives. The favorite foods of deceased relatives are prepared. The meal is usually consumed in total silence. After the meal, the food that was set out for the deceased is poured out in the woods as an offering to spirits. Another Wiccan high priestess, Marsha Smith, likewise describes the importance of Halloween for &quot;communion&quot; with departed spirits:<br/><br/>&quot;'It's a time to celebrate our ancestors and to communicate with the other side through meditation (or) tarot cards or by inviting the spirits to possess us,' she said. 'We believe souls are reincarnated and our loved ones come back to be with us again.'&quot; (Holly Edwards Staff Writer, Los Angeles Daily News)<br/><br/>While Halloween may be important for Catholics and pagans, fundamental Christians should avoid any association with or celebration of the day. The Bible teaches that sorcery will be revived in the last days, and that this would move God to bring the Tribulation curses upon mankind:<br/><br/>Revelation 9:21 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their SORCERIES, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.<br/><br/>The Bible also teaches that Rome will continue to &quot;whitewash&quot; pagan divination, until she becomes accepted as the center of world religion:<br/><br/>Revelation 17:5 And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.<br/><br/>There is NOTHING &quot;cute&quot; about witches and devils. Christians are losing the minds of their children by foolishly opening the gates to the enemy (through TV, movies, public education, pagan/Catholic holidays such as Halloween, etc.). Witchcraft is no longer cute and funny; it never was, but it especially is not cute in this late day, as thousands of teenagers are taking it seriously. Paul warns Christians that those who flirt with witchcraft will be excluded from the Kingdom of God (Galatians 5:20).<br/><br/>The ancient Druids were the &quot;priests&quot; of the Celtic religion. The Druid priests practiced horrible, mass human sacrifices on Halloween (although some modern pagans attempt to deny this fact, at least in public). Tacitus (the Roman historian) confirms this fact. The feast of Samhain (pronounced &quot;sow-win&quot;) was the feast of the dead. At this time, as we have seen, it was believed that the veil between the living and the dead (i.e. spirit world) was at its thinnest. I do believe the veil between the spirit world and the living is indeed at its thinnest at this time - not just on Halloween, but during this whole final age. However, it is not DEAD people, but DEVILS who are close at hand, ready for &quot;communion&quot; (1 Timothy 4:1, 2 Timothy 3:8). How long will it be before these devils once AGAIN (as with the Druids of old) begin to move mankind to practice the human sacrifices the Bible predicts will intoxicate Rome (Revelation 17:6)?<br/><br/>True Christians should ABSOLUTELY have NO alternatives on this day or night to even resemble or partake of this.  I think they should hit the streets and confront the world with strong preaching, or they should gather together for fervent prayer. Should such a night be an evening for fun, games, and &quot;mock&quot; divination for discerning Christians? Is there not a cause? Can we not rejoice in Christ in fellowship, spiritual songs, soul winning, and prayer, or must we imitate the joy of pagans and Catholics? What does it teach children when we train them that they must always have a &quot;Christian&quot; imitation of pagan fun? Will not many children soon realize that the world can &quot;out-do&quot; the Christian on pagan ground? I am certainly not against holy fun and recreation for children. I am against attempting to &quot;Christianize&quot; divination. I know there are many who teach that there is merit in attracting children to churches, away from a dangerous environment. Yet, many churches are having to become increasingly pagan and grotesque every year to attract the kids (who have been raised on horror movies with millions of dollars of special effects). &quot;Hell houses&quot; with rape, murder, suicide, blood and violence, acted out, etc. are sadly, becoming increasingly common in churches on Halloween.<br/><br/>But my main point is that Halloween is a pagan and Roman Catholic festival. Fundamental Christians should not have witches and skeletons on their doors.<br/><br/>May we be blessed and thankful for the Word of God saints on this day.  God bless you all.  Kim
