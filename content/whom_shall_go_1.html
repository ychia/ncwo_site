		&quot;From that, many of his disciples went back, and WALKED NO MORE WITH HIM. Then said Jesus unto THE TWELVE, &quot;Will ye also go away&quot;? Then Simon Peter answered him, &quot;LORD, TO WHOM SHALL WE GO&quot;? Thou hast the words of eternal life&quot;.--Jn.6:66-68<br/><br/>When one comes to the embracing of the Kingdom of God in his life, you will never be the same. Christianity, with all its multi-faceted faces, will bring a man to no change. With its over 250 different doctrines, denominations and organizations in America alone, the Kingdom of God has but one way, one truth, one life and one door. Man will continue to walk in the vanity of his mind, being led by emotions and feelings, views and opinions, and build his whole life off of what men say. Yet the Kingdom of God is what we must hold fast to. These were very profound words spoken by Peter. &quot;To whom shall we go&quot;? Not where, or what organization. But to WHOM shall we go? For THOU hast the words!!<br/>The very essence of our being is to win Christ. To know HIM through the power of the resurrection and to fellowship with HIS sufferings. To WHOM shall we go? Phil.3:7-15<br/><br/>Once you have put your hand to the plow, there is no looking back or you are not fit for the Kingdom.--Luke 9:62 We have burned all bridges behind us. There is no place, no doctrine, no denomination, no life to go back to. Our whole destiny lies BEFORE US, not behind us. All that will live Godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution--II Tim.3:12<br/><br/><br/>Our eternal life is in HIS words. &quot;For thou hast the &quot;words&quot; of eternal life--Jn.6:68 Our eternity is based on HIS foundation. We must learn, study and grow up in HIM. For in HIM we live and move and have our being! Acts 17:28 To whom shall we go? Many times in the midst of life, we are going to face challenges that can be very overwhelming. We will face times of heaviness and burdens, but to whom shall we go? We will at times want to give up, walk away, or just throw up our hands saying enough is enough--but to whom shall we go? We can at times be overwhelmed with the responsibilities of life, the burdens of finances, the struggles of general life, but to whom shall we go? There is no turning back. The Kingdom of God suffers violence, but the violent take it by force. We must be determined to keep our eyes on Jesus. We must be like Elisha (shadow and type of the church) who kept his eyes on Elijah (a shadow and type of Jesus) so that when He went up, a double portion of his spirit came upon him. Just like when Jesus went up, the Holy Ghost came down and brought the Word. Thus the Word and the Spirit. Your double portion. When David took on Goliath, he said, &quot;Let no mans heart faileth him&quot; because of this giant in the land. David said he came in the name of the living God, and Goliath ended up on HIS FACE!!! Do not turn back. Do not look back. Forget what is behind. Just keep pressing on. Keep moving forward. Keep raising the level of the Word of God and prayer in your lives. Keep straight. Keep strong. Keep boldness. Keep joy. Fight the good fight of faith. Keep the faith, finish your course. To whom shall we go? We have come so far that we truly have no place to go back to. There should be no escape routes in your plans. For it is HE that will deliver you. It is HE that will go before you. It is HE that will not forsake you. To whom shall we go? No yesteryears, no yesterdays, only Todays. We said, Jesus, be Lord, be Lord, be Lord, be Lord of our lives. Oh my King, I delight in thee. I will lay my life down to serve thee, love thee, worship thee, follow thee all the days of my life. To whom shall we go? In other words, there is none other to go to!! Only Jesus. Trust, believe, hold fast to, do not waver, just be stable in HIM. Built on the rock. May your destiny lie in HIS hands and not yours. May your tomorrows be molded, formed and fashioned after HIS hands and not yours. May the Word of God be one with you. Grow, multiply and prevail with the power of the Word. Buckle down, fight, fight, fight for the victory and see the goodness of our Lord. Pray for each other. Stand fast and firm with each other. Study, learn, exercise the Word in your life.<br/><br/>Every moment of each day, let the Word be working in you. Pray for Kenya Africa, the Philippines, the World Outreach Ministry that the Lord has graced us with. Press on. Praise HIS holy name. Oh Lord, I do not know if I can take much more. To whom shall we go? Oh Lord, but why am I here, and why is this happening to me? To whom shall we go? Oh Lord, I am tired, weary, troubled on every side, I see no progress. To whom shall we go? Trust HIM now for your tomorrow. Build and labor strong now, and dig deep for your foundation to be laid. Bear the cross, count the cost, continue on in HIM. Rejoice in your sufferings, great is your reward in heaven. Where WOULD you go? Where can you hide? What can take away your worries? ONLY HIM. ONLY JESUS!! To whom shall we go? To the Lord Jesus Christ. To the Word of God. To the light that becomes the life of all that walk in holiness. When things got tough,<br/>got hard, got difficult, got challenging, got tight, got rough, they walked with HIM no more. Will you walk away also? Or will you say in your heart today, &quot;TO WHOM SHALL I GO&quot;?<br/><br/>Be blessed. Kim
