			<h2>The Sacrifice of Living</br> in a World we are NOT of</h2>
			<em>Kim C. Gossett</em>
		</div>
		<div class="clearfix"></div>

		Beloved Saints of the Most High Father in heaven,<br/><br/> <br/><br/>I greet you all this day in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Those of you copied who live overseas in the Philippines or Kenya, I greet you this day and pray there are certain words that shall be spoken here that will change and BLESS your lives as well. From those of you in Olongapo, to Bungoma, to Siaya, may the Lord give you strength.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>First, I would like to encourage you all IN Spirit today, to understand and realize, that WHEN I write, I do so with the unction of the Spirit. I write when the Lord puts certain &quot;principles&quot; upon my heart to then share and bless you all. The Word of God can NOT be taken naturally or perceived naturally. TRUE worshippers, Jesus said, MUST worship the Father IN Spirit and IN truth (The Word). I pray that as your Shepherd, Elder, and SENT man of God, taking oversight to nations and lives, I pray you TAKE to heart that which is written. I pray you SELAH on the teachings, rest IN them saints and ponder them in your heart. When the Word of God is spoken, God NEVER said, just hear it and go on. God said to NOT LET THAT WHICH IS spoken SLIP past you. God said to PONDER, MEDITATE and SELAH DAILY.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hebrews 2:1-3 <br/>    Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. [2] For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; [3] How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;<br/><br/><br/>Notice the word SLIP here: <br/><br/>Greek 4482 (rheo); to flow by, i.e. (figurative) carelessly pass (miss) :- let slip.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>I pray Saints, that when I write to you, you are blessed and you LOOK forward to reading what is shared. I pray Saints, that with JOYFUL anticipation, your hearts HUNGER for the Word of God in a day when SO many are falling away, growing lukewarm and have not the zeal anymore they once had. I pray Saints, the messages shared, TRULY bless you as you meditate, ponder and deeply Selah on that which is spoken. I pray Saints, you TAKE TO heart, these teachings which are always framed by the Word of God AND the Spirit within me that God sets forth FOR YOUR lives and your family. Selah.  I pray saints, you read these letters when you have time at night before bed, when all is settled down and your thoughts and mind have TIME to just rest and ponder.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Notice above this warning from the Holy Spirit. True Kingdom believers are to take the MORE EARNEST HEED to the things we hear, LEST we let them SLIP by. We are instructed by the Holy Spirit to NEVER let the Word of God we hear, just PASS US CARELESSLY by. Oh, the soul man has a great way of letting that be. In other Words saints, the SPOKEN WORD of God is pure, holy, truth, yet HOW many carnally minded today, just believe what is written is written by MERE men or just by me alone?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>1 Thes. 2:13 <br/>    For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.<br/><br/><br/>Saints, the Apostles of God, THANKED God, without ceasing, that people received the Word of God they spoke, as being FROM God and not man. Amen and Amen. A few weeks ago, I wrote you all an email titled:  &quot;Saints--IF you &quot;Choose Life&quot;--You SURELY WILL have to Fight&quot;.  I would pray you have read that MORE than once since it was written. There are many spirituals in that saints. God wants us to ALWAYS ponder, and think about HIS Word. The MORE you give place to thinking, the MORE you ponder, the MORE you SELAH, the MORE the Holy Spirit reveals REVELATIONS to you. Yes, Saints, TO YOU. So many today are so naturally minded and so carnally minded for they only give place to Jesus in their soul and NOT heart or spirit man. They serve the Lord their own way and not HIS way. The Lord REVEALS himself to YOU saints, as YOU sit and ponder. So please take to heart all that is written. Please go back and read that email again I sent to you all on April 8th. There is much prophecying in there as well.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>There IS a SACRIFICE saints, we must ALL, yes WE MUST all fight in life IF we are going to live IN a World we are NOT of. Without sacrifice, there can be NO life in Christ. THE Lamb, must become OUR Lamb and HIS Cross, must become OUR Cross. HIS death MUST become OUR Death and HIS Sacrifice MUST become OURS. Selah again.  This is why saints, Paul said what we showed on Sunday in Philippians, that he wanted to come to KNOW Jesus. Not just believe IN HIM, but to KNOW Him AND the Power of the Resurrection (The Holy Spirit) AND Paul wanted to fellowship WITH Jesus' sufferings. Now, saints, IF you want to TRULY come to KNOW Jesus, not just believe IN Jesus, but KNOW HIM, then you MUST know the Power of the Holy Spirit AND you must fellowship, YES saints, fellowship with HIS sufferings. When you suffer for righteousness sake, YOU shall surely KNOW Jesus.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Now Jesus NEVER suffered healing the sick, giving sight to the blind, raising the dead, healing the lepers, the lame, the deaf, the dumb. Jesus NEVER suffered feeding the hungry or giving HOPE to those in despair. This brought great JOY to his heart and soul, even as you or I would experience. It takes NO suffering to minister life to others. When I go to Africa or the Philippines, there is joy in looking into the eyes of those hurting. When I was in Africa for those six months, I rejoiced to feed the hungry, build for the widows, care for orphans, care for the sick. Yet, the suffering came in body, in being there, in forsaking ALL to obey the Lord. I went to Africa because Jesus said GO, not because it was my will. When we FORSAKE our ways, and fight to do HIS will, persecution follows.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Where then did Suffer?  Jesus SUFFERED in Gethsemane AND Calvary. In Gethsemane, Jesus shed blood for the FIRST time for our sins of SELF WILL and I WILL over our Father's will in making sure we OBEY God and make GODLY decisions in life, NOT OURS. Jesus put his soul to death in Gethsemane and then shed blood to cover man's sin. So as the first Adam LOST relationship and obedience and the fear of God IN a garden, the Second Adam (Jesus--I Cor.15) bought BACK our relationship and obedience and fear IN a garden by shedding blood to cover OUR WILL, and forgive us for making OUR decisions in life against HIS Fathers. We saw on Sunday, how then Jesus was buried in a garden and resurrected in a garden. We will share more Sunday.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Now, today, I just want to share with you all the SACRIFICE you MUST make saints IN this life, NOW, Yes Saints, Today, IF you want eternal life. IF we live our lives in this world by being LIKE the world and OF the world, hanging out with the world, befriending the world, we shall NEVER see the Holy City. Paul said, IF we be risen with Christ, we must set our affections ABOVE and mortify, put to death, our bodies HERE on this earth.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Col. 3:1-6 <br/>    If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. [2] Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. [3] For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. [4] When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. <br/>    [5] Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: [6] For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:<br/><br/> <br/><br/>

		<img style="float: right" src="img/lampstand.png"/>

		Are we seeking that which is ABOVE?  Are we mortifying and putting to death that which is on this earth?  IF we are truly saved saints, NOT just believing we are saved, IF we are TRULY saved, then we must measure OUR lives now, today, here, by the Word of God. OUR lives are NOT our lives anymore, for IF we be Born AGAIN, we are a new creation, no longer living according to OUR wants, OUR desires, OUR purposes, OUR decisions. Oh, please get this in your spirit man today. Paul said IF, did you see it above? IF you be RISEN with Christ, which means to be risen, YOU must be buried first. Selah. HOW many Christians today talk about FREE WILL and how God gives US FREE WILL?  Saints, FREE WILL came AFTER the fall. When we are Born Again, we DIE to FREE will and that is really what Gethsemane is REALLY all about.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>There is a SACRIFICE to living for Christ saints. This world is evil, dark, titillating, desirous, lustful and there are SO SO many seductions out there today, that we MUST fight to stay focused and obedient and we must NOT TOUCH this world saints. There is a luring today, of a lustful spirit of self pleasure and self wants, OVER serving God. There is a spirit today taking hearts of God's children AWAY from the fear of God and further into pleasures of something NEW. God KNEW what we would face in life and therefore, HE GAVE us the blood of the lamb to OVERCOME the powers of darkness and HE gave us the POWER of the Holy Spirit to live HIS life within us, here on this earth.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Rev. 12:11 <br/>    And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>ARE you overcoming?  Are YOU laying it all down and is YOUR life a testimony of HIS Word?  As Paul again said, it is NO LONGER I who lives, but CHRIST lives in me. In other words, you MUST get the &quot;I&quot; out of your lives, thoughts, and decisions and get HIM, HIS, CHRIST in you.  There is Gethsemane again. It takes a great sacrifice in this day and hour to crucify the flesh. Yet saints, from the very beginning, Man HAD TO sacrifice as GOD sacrificed first. IF there be NO sacrifices in our lives, then what do we REALLY give to God?  IF you do NOT give up certain things in life to fight the flesh and overcome temptations, then what do YOU give to God? If you let your decisions rule your life, then what do YOU give to God?  If we do not sacrifice in anything we do for the Lord, then what do WE really give him? If there be no sacrifice, there is NO pain.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>LIFE is SACRIFICE saints, and we are living IN a world we are NOT of, so it will take TRUE SACRIFICE to make those more than just words. IT MUST become a part of your lives. This is why I always and continually share about your homes, your lives, you husbands loving and praying with your wives and you wives with your husbands. Laying down at night, arising in the morning, LET EACH DAY be a new day to serve the Lord in thought, deed and heart. It takes sacrifice in all things and even you parents with your children. It takes sacrifice to bear children and sacrifice to raise them.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>1 Tim. 2:15 <br/>    Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.<br/><br/><br/>Yet our LIVES consist NOT of what we personally attain on THIS earth, but what we SHALL attain on THAT day. We are called to DWELL in our ceiled houses and NOT let the World get in. We are to put the BLOOD OF JESUS on our doorposts and lintels and get inside and under the Blood for eternal life to be ours. Our homes are sanctuaries and though we LIVE in this world, we are to FLEE from the wrath to come. When we arise in the mornings and leave our habitations, we go out INTO a vicious and dark world controlled by forces unseen. PRAISE GOD saints you learn such at New Covenant. YET do you forget? So you let such teachings SLIP you by?  When the work day is going on, husbands, wives, be thinking of each other all day long. Longing to be back home, IN EACH others presence. Oh, if you could just grasp what is being said there in Spirit. This will produce a life you long to have. I know for some of you sisters, you wives who work, I know it is hard at times, but rejoice and KNOW, you are also supporting your homes, your husbands and YOUR King of Kings. Just know when the work day is over, you have EACH other and IN that, find HIS glory, amen.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>I share so much about loving each other, praying with each other, going to work and running home. Those are NOT words saints, but a LIFE we must live. This world grows more vicious daily and OUR lives MUST be a sacrifice to serve the Kingdom and NOT touch the ungodly or unclean. When your time is done for every given work day, get HOME saints, where life unfolds in your family and enjoy the time you have, for life is passing quickly. We ALWAYS think things will be better on the other side of the fence or change brings new life or if we try something NEW, it will be better. Our thoughts are always focused on seeking OTHER things, rather than building stronger what we have or sacrificing more to lay our lives down that situations live. NO saints, the change is NOT outside, but INSIDE the heart, that finds new life and new hope. It takes sacrifice to say NO to the soul, NO to your thoughts, NO to wanting to do this or that. It takes sacrifice to live holy, Godly, disciplined lives. It takes sacrifice to give to God first all we have, and then to trust and believe. It takes sacrifice to serve the family first, raise children, and dedicate your lives to each other. IF it came naturally, we would not need Jesus. If man could just live life BELIEVING in God, then what sacrifice would be involved. We must SACRIFICE the wants, desires and LURING of this world to walk FROM them and come out from them to SEE truth. It takes sacrifice to give saints and sow, and present before God our fruits. It takes sacrifice saints, and with no sacrifice, then again, WHAT do we give to God? It takes Sacrifice to pray, Sacrifice to FAST, Sacrifice to Praise. For you Youth, it takes SACRIFICE to give up Myspace and Facebook and ANY OTHER system of the beast out there whose roots are in the earth, yet the fun and pleasure seems so innocent. That is exactly what Satan wants us to think. That OUR decisions are innocent, when decisions are LIFE and death. Selah.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>HIS burdens, MUST become OUR burdens, and HIS sufferings, OUR sufferings. Jesus went to Gethsemane to SHOW you and I, we must GO there to overcome our will and our wants and our desires and our decisions which BIND us to the world and bring us into BONDAGE. We MUST let this mind, yes LET THIS MIND be IN YOU that is IN Christ Jesus--Phil.2:5. Again, it does NOT come naturally, but in Gethsemane it WILL come. It takes SACRIFICE saints to give UP our will to be done. WE must go to Calvary where HIS Cross MUST become OUR Cross saints. Yes, in Gethsemane, Jesus shed blood to bring his soul and wants and will unto subjection to the Father to teach us, AND Jesus went to Calvary to CRUCIFY HIS FLESH, which WE must do to overcome the lusts of this world and wants of covetousness and natural desires. In BOTH places PAIN was involved and Jesus took the greatest Pain of all. YET we must also carry OUR Cross, which was HIS Cross, IF we want eternal life. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE read each of these scriptures saints and remember JESUS is speaking to US, HIS disciples:<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Matthew 10:38 <br/>    And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Matthew 16:24 <br/>    Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Luke 9:23 <br/>    And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Luke 14:27 <br/>    And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.<br/><br/><br/>Well saints, I WANT TO BE DESIROUS OF HIM and I WANT TO BE WORTHY. Saints, Jesus was not talking about HIS, meaning HIS cross, but YOU bearing YOURS. OF course the Cross was HIS Cross, but that Cross, must become YOUR Cross in life saints. Look again and SELAH what Jesus was saying. HE was speaking to HIS disciples that THEY must bear THEIR Cross, and crucify THEIR flesh, as Jesus did HIS, to have eternal life. HOW do we do this? BY SACRIFICE. When do we do this? DAILY SAINTS. You must DIE daily. Not with a little slight, easy sloppy grace mentality. But a Gethsemane experience of condemning this world, abhoring evil and coming OUT from amongst it. BE NOT enslaved saints.

		<br/><br/> <br/><br/> IF you play in the world, you will SURELY die in the world and WITH the world. IF you fellowship with the world, you will SURELY die with those in the world and WITH the world. IF you make friends with the world, you will SURELY die spiritually in the world and WITH those in the world. The Bible says COME OUT from amongst the ungodly, the unsaved, the unruly, AND the unholy. COME OUT from amongst carnality and even those who profess to believe in Jesus, but their lives are measured by the PLEASURES of the world. Saints, remember Moses?  Look at this:<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hebrews 11:24-28 <br/>    By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; [25] Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; [26] Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. [27] By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. [28] Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Saints, LOOK at this scripture and dig deep. BY FAITH, Moses REFUSED to be called a son of Pharoah, or to us, a son of the world. BY FAITH, Moses CHOSE, yes it is a CHOICE saints!!!!!  CHOOSE YE THIS DAY, whom you shall serve!!  As for me saints, I and my family will serve the Lord and NOT by Christianity standards or being good, but living AT the Tree of LIFE.  BY FAITH, Moses CHOSE to suffer affliction with the people of God, RATHER THAN enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. Did you SEE it saints???  To SERVE Jesus, TO HONOR the Lord in life, YOU MUST SUFFER with the Children of God, just like Paul said he wanted to fellowship with HIS sufferings. YET, in choosing to suffer for Christ, YOU overcome the PLEASURES OF SIN. This shows the world OFFERS pleasures, Jesus offers sufferings, YET WHEN YOU DIE, the world offers you DEATH and Jesus offers you LIFE!!!  SELAH.   Moses esteemed the reproach OF CHRIST, even then, as being GREATER RICHES than the treasures of this world. THIS is why we do NOT build our treasures on earth, build our kingdoms here or our covetousness. BY FAITH, Moses FORSOOK Egypt, which is WHY I always teach, share, preach that YOU MUST forsake this world, saints. Yet, Moses did this and DID NOT fear the king, which means we do NOT fear earthly rulers, bosses, jobs, etc, in exchange for saving souls. Why? Because Moses SAW the invisible God and YOU can TOO saints, if you step through the veil of the flesh.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>THIS is why fasting, praying, crucifying the flesh and condemning the world and OBEYING God brings you to life. THIS is why I share about the scriptures in I Cor. 7, where husbands and wives WILFULLY TOGETHER, choose to obstain from their beautiful joinings naturally to fast AND pray to strengthen themselves UNTO THE LORD IN HEAVEN, before coming back together again. It builds a bond of love beyond words and gives a power where ONE puts a thousand to flight and TWO put ten thousands. This is why I share about a wife, praying with her husband, encouraging him, supporting, undergirding, being that help mete and companion, as Pr.31 as well as the husband praying and covering his wife to protect her spiritually. Sure we all fail at times in this, but we learn and grow and commit more daily. THERE IS LIFE in this saints and it causes YOU to step through that veil and SEE the invisible God. OH SELAH THIS DAY!!  IT takes sacrifice saints for YOU to say NO to the flesh and YES to the Spirit within.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Matthew 26:41 <br/>    Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.<br/><br/><br/>The SACRIFICE of Living IN a World we are NOT of, takes faith saints and obedience. It takes faith AND sacrifice to give to the Kingdom saints. When we live in such hard times, difficult times, they will grow worse. While the ungodly and unclean drown their lives in drinking wine, getting high, partying on weekends or fornicating for worldly pleasures, the RIGHTEOUS lay their lives down in obedience to sacrifice THIS world for THE ONE to come. Selah again.  It takes Sacrifice to give saints, for if there be no sacrifice, there is NO Sweet savor before the Lord of Glory.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Philip. 4:10 <br/>    But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.<br/><br/>Philip. 4:16-18 <br/>    For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. [17] Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. [18] But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Never give your tithe or offering saints to paying a bill, buying food, putting gas in a car, making a payment to the world. NEVER saints give that which is HOLY to the dogs. Pr.3 says you HONOR and WORSHIP God by giving the FIRSTFRUITS of your increase.  I know the hearts you have and I thank God for those who give regularly and faithfully. I thank God you have learned what you have. In tight times, which we are in, NEVER forget the Lord thy God. Again, Sacrifice as we just saw. Remember your Elders saints and YOUR Oxen. We forsake ALL that you may live. I know our Elders abroad in the P.I and Africa have walked away from all to serve lives before we all die. Here, we give our all, so do not forget us in prayer and giving saints. Even today, Charles is at his interview, and I pray for a miracle Praise Report soon. Charles gave UP ALL to go To Africa and gave up ALL to come back to work hope in the ministry. His wife Joyce, gave up HER life the day she married Charles, as any wife does the day she joins her husband. They are here now, though their hearts are in Africa. Yet, remember our needs as well saints. Praise God you have jobs, yet remember us when you give. It takes sacrifice. When things are tight, I always learned to give. We have needs always saints, for we labor FOR you. I have no job, I have a calling, yet I live by faith. Remember me as well.  When I got my tax credit for my daughter this year, I used it all for Africa and defending the ministry there. I pray many of you are blessed this year with tax returns, but do not forget the Lord or us your Ox. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>It takes sacrifice to pray and fast saints, it takes sacrifice at times fathers, when you get home after a long day, to make sure you give TIME and life to your wives and children. Paul was not married but HE KNEW marriages by the Spirit. I try so much to share life with you all that YOU never take for granted the live you have with each other. Every day, just might be your last day with each other. We are never guaranteed tomorrow. When you husbands get home, when you wives get home, give the FIRSTFRUITS of your heart to each other. That little hug, that little kiss, that little I LOVE YOU, will change your lives. It softens the heart from the hardness of the world we enter daily. Selah. It takes sacrifice to put YOUR life before others. It takes sacrifice to say NO to this world and all that we do. I pray today saints, you would remember the word sacrifice. IF we sacrifice NOTHING from our life to our Father in heaven and our Lord Jesus, then we are missing the beauty of HIS Kingdom. Jesus said HIS Kingdom is NOT of this world and you can NOT see it with worldly eyes. I pray you remember that today. It takes SACRIFICE to serve Jesus with all your heart. I pray today, you remember the evil out there and those seducers who abound. I pray you remember YOUR Kingdom this day and YOUR homes and your sanctuaries and your families.  Bring the Word into your homes DAILY, nightly. Husbands, wives, spend time together in that Book of Life.  I pray you remember today, the LIFE we have here, is but a moment in time. Our lives are passing by, so may we CHERISH every moment we have with each other.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Jeremiah 33:11 <br/>    The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the Lord of hosts: for the Lord is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the Lord.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hebrews 13:15 <br/>    By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.<br/><br/><br/>The days grow MORE evil saints. COME OUT from amongst this world, and be IN it but surely NOT of it. Remember the invisible world around you and the beings that rule it. Live holy, Godly, disciplined lives. Live fasted, prayer filled, Bible time daily lives. Live for each other in love and know the days in which you live. Stay OUT of Dens of iniquity, give NO place to the devil. Give all you have saints to the saving of SOULS. When the early Church was born, God's people, they surely came OUT from amongst this world. May we do the same. EVERY ESSENCE OF YOUR BEING, give to God. Let NOT this world deceive you, snare you, entrap you, capture you or LURE you, for it will kill you and kill the spirit within.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>I love you all, so very much. Pray for me daily, as your Shepherd, pray for my daughter, I miss her so much, yet remember me today, for surely I need that more today than ever before. May we ALL say, not just in word, but IN DEED, &quot;IT IS NO LONGER I WHO LIVES,  BUT CHRIST WHO LIVES IN ME. God bless you all, Kim
