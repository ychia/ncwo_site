		<p>Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2 Peter 1:12 (KJV)</p>

		<p>Here are some teachings of "current issues" in the Kingdom of God. God desires us to be continually partaking of "present-day truth", and not relying only on yesterday's manna or Word. We have documented some of the teachings and writings and wanted to share them with those you who are hungry for the truth. Jesus said, sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. John 17:17 (KJV). We should no longer desire or be led to be force-fed the teachings and doctrines of men, what we call modern Christianity. In this last day we are warned that many will no longer endure sound doctrine and will heap to themselves teachers having itching ears- 2 Tim 4. The radio airwaves and most network Christian TV broadcasts are filled with the doctrines of men. What you read on this page has nothing to do with any man’s opinion’s or belief’s, but comes right from the very Word of God and is established by two or three witnesses. 2 Corinthians 13:1. "In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established." Amen. (So be it). So let us be like those who in the book of Acts Chapter 2 verse 37, were pricked in their heart by the hearing of the Word of God that was preached, and said "What must I do..", realizing the need for change, not only in thought but in deed. May the Holy Spirit be your teacher and may He teach you divine order, divine authority, and divine truth. Be blessed and please feel free to contact us and communicate all good things of what the Lord has blessed you with in these teachings.</p>
