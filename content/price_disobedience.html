   Praise the Lord and God bless all you God fearing, saints of the most High and Almighty God. I greet you all this day in the mercy, grace and love of our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. I greet those of you CALLED to be saints, and separated unto holiness and Godliness, as you perfect holiness in the fear of God. <br/><br/>2 Cor. 7:1-4 <br/>    Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. <br/>    [2] Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man. [3] I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you. [4] Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation. <br/><br/>I greet all nations this day, from San Jose to Kenya Africa, to Philippines, to India, to Pakistan. I pray all of you this day, will pray and honor the Lord with all your hearts. I pray you know you are cared for and even as Paul said above, GREAT was his speech toward the saints, great was his boldness, because he loved them. Saints, I care so deeply for you, your lives, your callings, your purpose in serving Jesus Christ. I pray we remember the scriptures well this day, as God SO loved us, HE gave us HIS WORD and HIS Word, protects us and gives us all truth. We are warned and warned again, about the last days, seducing spirits, doctrines of devils, spiritual forces hindering and destroying marriages, fornications, adulteries, apostate hearts, becoming dull to hear the Word. We are warned about rebellion to authority, deceitfulness of sin, hardening of hearts, walking away from the living God and turning from truth unto fables. We are warned about perilous times, lukewarmness engulfing souls, deception, and the price paid by the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. ALL these words were spoken NOT to heathen unbelievers, but to BELIEVERS!!! Saints, be not deceived, God IS not mocked and for us to KNOW truth and obey it NOT, we will be held to a greater accountability. Elders in the nations, along with your wives, be bold, strong and blameless. Let your marriage be anchored in hope, love and be committed to each other as one in Christ. Your lives are to represent LIFE and HOPE to many suffering and hurting. Be men and women of repentance, forever growing, forever learning and forever PROTECTING the flock with truth, and take oversight to their lives to keep the wolves from gaining entry. <br/><br/>Just that paragraph above saints, frames the HOUR WE LIVE IN. When do we open our eyes? When do we realize the depth of disobedience? When we live in an hour when FEW men of God are preaching such, or few men of God preaching holiness, few men of God preaching against sin, few men truly preaching KINGDOM, brokenness, the fear of God, Judgment day coming, we see rampant spiritual death all around us. We live in a day when men and women have become a law to themselves and because they SAY THEY LOVE Jesus, or they SAY they believe in Jesus, FEW obey the Son of God. FEW honor the lamb of God. They trodden under foot the blood that once sanctified them, and insult the Holy Spirit, ALL the while they say they walk in light. Yet they hearken to NO authority, NO chastisement, NO subjection to God fearing men of God set over them in the Lord. Few today receive chastisement or correction, for the spiritual forces unseen have SNARED THEIR SOULS and death, eternal death, knocks at the door of their hearts. Let's look at just a few scriptures of the MANY written.<br/><br/>Ephes. 2:2 <br/>    Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: <br/><br/>Ephes. 5:6 <br/>    Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. <br/><br/>Col. 3:6 <br/>    For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: <br/><br/>1 Tim. 4:1-3 <br/>    Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; [2] Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; [3] Forbidding (stopping, hindering, withholding, put off) to marry,

   <img style="margin: 10px; display: block; float: right;" src="img/sword2.png"/>

   <br/><br/>2 Tim. 3:1 <br/>    This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. <br/><br/>2 Tim. 4:3-4 <br/>    For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; [4] And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. <br/><br/>Hebrews 2:1-2 <br/>    Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. [2] For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; <br/><br/>Hebrews 3:12-15 <br/>    Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. [13] But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. [14] For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end; [15] While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. <br/><br/>Hebrews 4:1 <br/>    Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. <br/><br/>Hebrews 10:26-31 <br/>    For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, [27] But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. [28] He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: [29] Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? [30] For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. [31] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. <br/><br/>Oh, saints, the Word of God goes on and on and on about sinning, disobedience, and the price we will pay for shunning truth. When you look at just a few of these scriptures, you can see saints, the LAST DAYS do not paint a good picture of life. Spiritual darkness will fill the world, nations, people. I thank God for New Covenant, I thank God for this ministry, I thank God for KINGDOM authority and Kingdom truth. Today people sin, then go looking for ministers and preachers who will appease their souls to say, ALL IS WELL, ALL IS OKAY, just go on, God loves you, when hell awaits at the end of such a road. We are warned saints about false teachers, false prophets, false apostles in the last days, THEREFORE, I pray we stay sharp. God NEVER gave HIS children license to sin, or permission to sin or to take sin lightly. We are warned about GODLY SORROW which worketh repentance unto salvation and the SORROW OF THE WORLD, which worketh death. Paul made people sorry with his letters, yet he rejoiced if they SORROWED UNTO REPENTANCE. This year here at New Covenant, San Jose, the Lord has poured out HIS glory, HIS love, HIS purpose, HIS truth in the Apostolic and Prophetic authority. Our services have been powerful, glorious, yet filled with the fear of God in preaching, yet we REJOICE with unspeakable joy. OUR hearts are FILLED with HIS love, in knowing such truth. God has warned HIS children of the last days, the seduction of lives, marriages, apostasy of hearts. When do WE take a close look into the mirror of our own hearts?  Saints, God so loved us, HE GAVE US HIS WORD!! <br/><br/>You men of God in the nations, you ordained Elders, with your wives, who are your companions for life, help metes for life, for the woman was made FOR the man, and what a great HONOR to be an Elders wife, you are called to preach truth, preach with authority and boldness in the LOVE of Christ, that we sin not. You Elders wives, rejoice to have borne children to your husbands, giving offspring to God, for HIS glory. Your place and role is a great HONOR at the sides of your husbands, in serving Jesus Christ and ministering LIFE to those around you in the nations. Be pure in heart and honor your husbands with all greatness of heart. And IF we do fall in sin, we repent, ask God to forgive us and we go and sin no more. We are called by Jesus to COUNT THE COST, to see if we have sufficient to FINISH the race set before us. The cost of disobedience, will be the greatest price we all pay in life. For Jesus said in Mt. 7, ON THAT DAY, many will confess, Lord, Lord and yet HE will say, depart from me. The Word of God saints, warns the true and living saints of God, to BEWARE less they fall from their own steadfastness. We live in a day when CHRISTIANITY is the way, when in truth, the KINGDOM OF GOD is the ONLY way. One preaches man's doctrines and belief, the other, ONLY JESUS Christ and HIM crucified with obedience to the Father. <br/><br/>Col. 2:8 <br/>    Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. <br/><br/>2 Peter 3:17 <br/>    Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. <br/><br/>We are warned about FALLING away, being polluted again with the sins of the world, ways of the world, and becoming lukewarm to such sin, when we ought to have our hearts broken before God to thank HIM for mercy and love to cover such sins. <br/><br/>2 Peter 2:20-22 <br/>    For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. [21] For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. [22] But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. <br/><br/>As these last days are here, my heart is broken to SEE the lives many live in the name of Jesus. Carnality, flesh, rebellion to truth, no fear, is where most live today for Jesus. This ought NOT to be. Yet we are told, it WILL be in the last days. Saints we live in a day when spiritual forces UNSEEN, will be unleashed upon mankind and cause MANY to be deceived and led astray. The last day onslaught of the enemy we are TOLD, will be unleashed with great wrath, for Satan KNOWS his days are short. WHEN DO WE FEAR God saints, to live holy Godly lives? WHEN do we take to heart the seriousness of the times? WHEN do we humble ourselves to OBEY God and condemn this world? We live in a day when sin will again abound because men's hearts will wax worse and worse and the love of many will GROW cold. It does not say, just BE cold, they will GROW cold. Men of God in the nations, you Elders and wives,  hold the saints to accountability and let them know our Father in heaven LOVES them, but that love does NOT give permission to sin without a cause. Protect them with preaching of truth and be PURE OF THE BLOOD OF ALL, by not holding back any truth. We are warned three times in the Bible about being children of DISOBEDIENCE. Since when do we allow OUR flesh to dominate our lives? We live in a day and hour in the body of Christ, where Adultery runs rampant, marriages being torn and broken, fornications abound amongst many, YET no such people will enter the Kingdom of God. Men of God, let the saints know, NO fornicators will make it, and the only way to stop such sin, is either SEPARATE and sin no more till marriage, OR get married. Jesus said better to marry, than burn in the flesh for one another. It has to be either one, either abstain and repent, or get married and then honor the marriage vow. Men of God in the nations, let ALL know, only God can give instructions on WHAT to do and HOW to do it. For those who commit adultery, God says Adultery is to be forgiven!! Just as Jesus forgave the women taken in the act, in Jn. 8, HE said go and sin NO more. That means saints we can live a life of NOT sinning. <br/><br/>John 8:4 <br/>    They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. <br/><br/>John 8:10-11 <br/>    When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? [11] She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. <br/><br/>You see here, Jesus FORGAVE Adultery, and said go and sin no more, meaning go HOME, go to your husband. That is what Jesus said, GO HOME. Men of God in the nations, adultery kills, it hurts, it wounds, it blinds, it deceives, it breaks hearts, spirits, destroys the most powerful covenant outside salvation, yet the power of God is to forgive. You men let saints know, it can NOT continue, and when forgiven, they go home. If a man commits adultery against his wife, she is to forgive him, and though the pain is the greatest in the innocent one, God still helps, because our love ought to be greater than sin and love covers a multitude of sins. Yet the husband must go home to his wife, IF she will have him. If a woman commits adultery, God says GO HOME, back to your husband, and honor your vows, for IF your husband forgives you as Christ forgives HIS bride the church, then a woman MUST go home, less she perish. Though Jesus did say, that was the only way a marriage could be finished, HE would rather have forgiveness. Therefore, let saints know, that adultery IS forgiven and if the one violated forgives, the one who sinned, is bound to remain and honor their vow forever. THAT is the law of God. That is the law of God. We need to LEARN the Word saints, and you men of God NEED to know HOW to minister to such situations. We live in a day when many are being tempted, taken, sheep going to a slaughter, yet we are to fight to the end. We live in a day and hour when SIN is no longer preached with fire and authority, it has become permissible and taken lightly. <br/><br/>I pray you all remember to be on your knees, in prayer, coming OUT of this world, touching NOT the unclean. Let not your hearts DIE or become SO hardened you lose truth or the fear of God. <br/><br/>Psalm 36:1 <br/>    The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes. <br/><br/>Romans 3:18 <br/>    There is no fear of God before their eyes. <br/><br/>Ephes. 5:21 <br/>    Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. <br/><br/>Job 28:28 <br/>    And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. <br/><br/>Psalm 19:9 <br/>    The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. <br/><br/>Psalm 34:11 <br/>    Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord. <br/><br/>Psalm 111:10 <br/>    The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever. <br/><br/>Proverbs 1:7 <br/>    The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. <br/><br/>Proverbs 8:13 <br/>    The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. 

   <img style="margin: 10px; display: block; float: left;" src="img/ark1.png"/>

   <br/><br/>SELAH and take to heart. Saints, the greatest DECEPTION today, is that people believe sinning is not a big issue anymore, and all they have to do is say SORRY GOD. It does not work that way saints. We are called to crucify OUR flesh daily, DIE daily, LIVE for Jesus in holiness, for without holiness, NO MAN will see the Lord. Jesus said, when any become prodigal, walk away, sin, break vows, dishonor the Word, IF they were saved before, IF they knew the law and IF they were taught truth, Jesus said, they MUST GO HOME. The Prodigal son did not just repent, he went HOME. Those who left their first love in Rev.2, Jesus said, REMEMBER FROM WHERE you fell, and go BACK and get back on that path and do they first works. Saints, we can NOT live lives according to OUR terms or OUR ways, and be saved. Impossible. <br/><br/>My heart is overwhelmed in these last days to see how many, truly do NOT fear God anymore. IF we sin, God says GO AND SIN NO MORE. I pray you Elders and Wives in the nations, remember WHY you do what you do and REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE!  From the day the Lord SENT me to Kenya Africa, in August 1984, my life was never the same. The VISION came, and I have never been disobedient to that heavenly vision--<br/><br/>Acts 26:16-19 <br/>    But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; [17] Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, [18] To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. [19] Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: <br/><br/>Saints, I have dedicated my life, my heart, my soul, my body, my spirit, to serve the nations. I lived out of suitcases for years, staying in places which would be for some of you, your worse nightmare, yet in all things, God changed ME and taught ME how to give my life that others live. I have raised my daughter in the fear of God, kept her untouched from the world, and given her to be that faithful handmaiden to the Lord. My wife Olga, changed nations with me, sat under trees in Kenya teaching women, some who remember to this day the heart she had, and she stood in schools in Uganda teaching women, stood at my side in hospitals in the bush, caring for the dying, serving nations, yet I know the pain of losing her to this world and deception. Satan HATES obedience and he HATES Kingdom people who fear God and destroy his earthly kingdom. I pray today saints, we ALL hold fast to life, hold fast to repentance, obedience and that we OBEY God always. If we sin, we have a loving advocate, our Lord Jesus and we have the blood. But God forbid we trodden UNDER foot that blood and dishonor God. <br/><br/>To those of you in Africa, prepare and rejoice that SOON, very soon, you will see Charles and Joyce and their boys again. Rejoice a precious sister named Deanna is coming to live in Kenya. May we ALL fight to the end saints, be holy, for HOLY IS HE who called you all to life. Lay down YOUR lives to serve NOT this world, but the Kingdom of God. Do NOT bow your knees to this world, do NOT violate your vows to God, do NOT take your hand off the plow. Do NOT dishonor the blood at Calvary, REPENT, be tenderhearted and DO the Word of God. Though many today believe God's love is GREATER than judgment, they must know, God's LOVE is HIS judgment to those who shun it. May we all COUNT THE COST saints, and know, there is NO place for the devil in our lives, marriages, homes, or walk with the Lord, Keep your homes sanctified in holiness. LIVE BY FAITH, not by sight. You wives of Elders, be on your knees for your husbands. BE like Ruth who laid in humility at the feet of Boaz. Pray for them to be strong and faithful. LOVE your husbands, honor them, reverence them. You Elders, LOVE your wives, care for them, be tender, loving, kind, gentle, and porter and protect them well. Cherish them with all your hearts, for they are YOUR gift from God. Saints, do NOT bow your knees to deception or deceit. Be wise, be sober, be sharp, be alert, be watchful, and LIVE IN THE SPIRIT. God bless you all, and PRAISE GOD for our salvation this day.<br/><br/>Philip. 2:12-16 <br/>    Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. [13] For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. [14] Do all things without murmurings and disputings: [15] That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; [16] Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. <br/><br/>1 Peter 1:13-16 <br/>    Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; [14] As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: [15] But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; [16] Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. <br/><br/>GOD BLESS YOU ALL, Brother Kim
