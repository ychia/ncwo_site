	<div class="box">Headquartered in San Jose, California, New Covenant World Outreach is a non-denominational ministry dedicated to the vision of the nations. We feed the hungry, clothe the poor, distribute Bibles, and preach the Word of God. </br>Click the flags above for a tour of our ministries around the world.</br></br>The Lord said, "And you shall be my witnesses unto the utter most parts of the earth". As faithful servants, this team represented the Government of God with Eldership Ministry and the office of the Deacon in building Kingdom foundations in Africa, as we build with the Apostolic Order ordained by the Lord Jesus Christ. As Paul said in Acts 15:36, "Let us go AGAIN, to see how our brethren are doing", we therefore faithfully commit our lives to those the Lord has given us the "Seal of Apostleship" to--I Cor.9. Our purpose and vision at New Covenant World Outreach is to continue to maintain a dedicated life to serve continually those who are sent to Kenya and the Philippines. Building relationship and joints and marrow is a foundation of building the Kingdom of God in the earth. The word "missionary" is never recorded NOR found written in the Word of God. What is recorded is those that were "SENT" to build, plant and glorify the Lord in representing the Kingdom of God, and maintaining subjection to and remaining under authority at all times from the "Spiritual Antioch" from which they were sent----Acts 13-14. We shall forever be with those the Lord has SENT us to and shall continue to feed the hungry, clothe the poor, distribute Bibles freely to the nations and give Medical supplies when possible.</div>
