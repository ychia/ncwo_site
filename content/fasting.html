		Praise the Lord and God bless you all this day. What I send below, is to be taken soberly, yet joyfully. I pray you rejoice in this and embrace the depth of the power in FASTING. I pray it will surely bless you in LIFE and cause you to all grow even more, in HIS presence. How blessed we are saints for such a ministry as New Covenant, that works and labors to build YOUR lives in the Kingdom of God. Fasting truly helps OPEN our Spiritual eyes and close our natural eyes. Praise God. I pray this teaching blesses you men in Africa, India, Philippines, Pakistan and Myanmar and blesses the saints.  Please take to heart this teaching, read ALL scriptures and LEARN them well. For you Elders copied here in the nations, may you print this out, study it, and may you and your wives begin to realize as well, the power behind such a life. I pray you are all blessed this day IN Spirit, and each passing day, you grow stronger in spirituals. The Holy Spirit began our New Year, by ending the old with prayer and fasting for those who chose, and started with teaching on Fasting this past World Outreach Sunday. As the world perished in revellings, drunkenness and lasciviousness, I give thanks we were UNDER the blood, safely protected.<br/> <br/>What a great and wonderful blessing God gave us on Sunday, as a glorious day to hear from all the nations. Below saints, I have sent to you a teaching and sharing on FASTING. I pray we would ponder, Selah and meditate upon the IMPORTANCE and truly serious principle of fasting. After all, it was the VERY FIRST THING our Lord Jesus ever did, as he started the purpose of being SENT with HIS earthly ministry. Please take time this week, to study this, by prayer and asking the Holy Spirit to truly reveal the &quot;spirituals&quot; behind it. Remember, we seek ALL truth, IN SPIRIT. I pray as you read all the scriptures and read their context, you will see how different fasts, were experienced for different purposes, yet in either way, it produced LIFE to those who entered into it with pure seeking hearts. Fasting is a joyous time, when we hunger for such, yet we also do &quot;mourn&quot; in Spirit, as the Holy Spirit beareth witness with OUR spirit, the depth of what lies within us that needs to be purged before a HOLY God. Selah<br/> <br/>FAST, FASTING, FASTED:<br/> <br/>Fasting is a very powerfully ordered principle in the Word of God which brings life, sensitivity and subjection of OUR spirit man unto the subjective purpose of our Father in Heaven. It brings a life to those who long to grow more in the presence of holiness, purity, obedience and TRUST of our Lord Jesus, the Word of God, and the releasing more of the power of the Holy Spirit within us. It brings us to a place of trusting the Word of God, HIS promises and also causes our flesh to be brought in subjection to the Spirituals in life we are commanded to follow. Fasting is the laying aside of food for a period of time when we as the children of God, long and desire to know God in a deeper experience. It is to be done as an act before God in the privacy of one&#x2019;s own pursuit of God, by letting their own heart and spirit LONG for HIS presence (Exodus 34:28; 1 Samuel 7:6; 1 Kings 19:8; Matthew 6:17). Spiritual fasting entails setting aside activities as well as reducing intake of food and replacing these activities with the exercise of prayer and resting in the presence of the Word of God, which then produces a preoccupation with spiritual concerns.  The New Testament word which is translated &#x201c;fast or fasting&#x201d; literally means: to abstain from food, withhold food.<br/> <br/>There are three different types of fasts generally recognized in the scriptures for God's children. The fourth mentioned here, is what I like to call a &quot;Corporate Fast&quot;, where the Elders beckon and call the saints to fast TOGETHER.  For the individual:  NORMAL &#x2014;in which there is no intake of food for a prescribed period of time, though there may be an intake of liquids.  PARTIAL&#x2014;in which the diet is limited, though some food is allowed;  ABSOLUTE&#x2014;in which there is total abstinence from food and liquids in all forms.  WHOLE ASSEMBLY&#x2014;where the Elders would call for ALL the people to partake together showing their oneness and unity of heart.  Many times in fasting corporately, there is a unity of spirit, soul and body as ALL partake.  This is usually directed under the authority of Eldership Rule for the sake of the whole body. There is a sense of spiritual intuitiveness that grows in fasting. When we seriously enter into such, it is joyful, yet also revealing saints. When we fast as children of God, it brings us into being ONE with our Father in heaven, and when we Corporately Fast, it brings us into being ONE in Spirit as a body of believers and in the Marriage Covenant--(I Cor.7:4-5) when husbands and wives fast &quot;together&quot;, in brings the TWO into being ONE in body, soul and spirit. Selah again.<br/> <br/>In the Old Testament the fast was regarded as an act of self-renunciation designed to withhold (push back, delay, stop) God&#x2019;s wrath and move HIM to act in gracious disposition.  In times of emergency, the people fasted to persuade God to spare them from impending calamity.  (Jgs. 20:26;  I Sam.7:6;  I Kgs.21:9;  II Chr.20:3 and Jer.36:6,9)  Many times individuals fasted in the hope that God would liberate and deliver them from trouble&#x2014;(II Sam.12:16-20;  I Kgs.21:27;  Ps.35:13;  69:10)  Fasting was regarded as being mixed with prayer to assure that God would answer prayers  (Ezr.8:21;  Neh.1:4; Jer. 14:12)  Throughout the Old Testament, fasting was associated with an attitude of crying out to God for his aid in times of need. Yet, there were also times when they fasted after the flesh and for selfish gain reasons, which God will never answer accordingly. WHEN we fast, we MUST fast by HIS teaching.<br/> <br/>Regular fasts were usually for one day, morning until evening, with food permitted at night (Jgs.20:26;  I Sam.14:24;  II Sam.1:12)  although there are many reports of longer fasts, such as Mordecai&#x2019;s call for a 3-day fast (night and day specified)  Est.4:16 and the 7-day fast at Sauls death (I Sam.31:13;  II Sam.3:35).  Among other noted fasts&#x2014;David&#x2019;s 7-day fast for the life of his son with Bathsheba (II Sam.12:18)  Mose&#x2019;s 40 day fast on Mt. Sinai (Ex. 34:28)  and Daniel&#x2019;s 3&#x2014;week fast prior to his receiving visions  (Dan.9:3; 10:3,12)<br/> <br/>In general, Old Testament fasting slowly became abused. The heart of the people remained hardened and instead of a sincere act of self-renunciation,denial and submission to God, their fasting became external, ritualistic and an empty ritual. By doing this, a false pretense of piety (holiness) was presented as a public image, one of which Jesus condemned when talking about the New Testament fasting in the presence of the Pharisees and people.  From this, the prophets cried out against the callousness and hypocrisy of the people.  Jeremiah records the Lord God as saying, &#x201c;Though they fast, I will not hear their cry&#x201d; (Jer.14:12; see also Isa.58:1-10)<br/> <br/>The setting for the New Testament fasting now begins.  Its understanding lies in the development of the rabbinic tradition that grew out of the period between the Old and New Testaments. During this time, fasting became the distinguishing mark of the pious Jews, even though it was merely ritualistic.  It was through this attitude that the Pharisees taught the people that their holiness was an outward act of fasting by appearance and observing of fast days, both public and private, yet condemned by Jesus for being false piety. You read this in the parable Jesus shared in Luke 18:9-14. In the times of the disciples of John the Baptist, or the times the Pharisees, the real prevailing mood of fasting when Jesus appeared on the scene, was one of sadness, heaviness, sorrow of burden and a self-imposed requirement to produce discipline to bring about self-denial. Yet Jesus spoke in Mt.6 about fasting being of joy, anointing thine head, preparing thyself clean. Zech.8 also shares about the gladness and joy of fasting cheerfully unto God. Yet IN THE SPIRIT saints, the MORE you fast, the more your heart reveals within, ALL that needs to be cleansed. The Spirit will reveal this to you.<br/> <br/>Jesus&#x2019; understanding of fasting is significant in that it represents a shift in the role of fasting.  His initial attitude undoubtedly reflected the fact that the true way of fasting in the Kingdom of God, breaks away from all rabbinic tradition.  Two accounts of HIS fasting are important.  One in the Wilderness (Mt.4:2; Lu.4:2) and HIS teaching on fasting on the Sermon on the Mount (Mt.6:16-18).  HIS temptation was born out of purpose and out of  struggle.  Immediately after his baptism, he was led into the wilderness by the Spirit to face, as the second Adam, the temptation of Satan, the god of this world. Our Lord fasted first to show, the spirit of man would overcome the flesh of man, to withhold and resist the temptations Satan would throw at us to sin. Saints, FASTING produces POWER in Spirit.  In the midst of this, he fasted and prayed, quoting from Deut.8:3 and Ps.91:11-12.  His fasting here shows us TOTAL DEPENDANCY ON GOD.  <br/> <br/>On the mount, his teaching on fasting, showed a spiritual approach to truth, that condemns the fasting which seeks favor with men and others, but instead brings about a wholesome and true faith in seeking a pure and holy relationship with the Father through a pure heart.  This true fasting brings brokenness, submission, gratitude, joy and thanksgiving.    It allows our self wants and desires to be willfully laid at the feet of the Father where HIS strength, power and grace fulfill our emptiness and shallowness that continually cause our flesh and carnality to rule us.  A Spirit ruled life is to be a fasted life.  One of disciplining the flesh and when mixed with prayer, it allows us to sense and feel the real Spiritual life of the Kingdom. Fasting saints, produces a spiritual SENSITIVITY and also a humbling humility of trusting God, for though we were unworthy in all aspects of salvation, HIS love for us, opened that door to come into HIS holiness. It allows us to be sensitive to HIS voice and grounds our faith to bring a Spiritual growth of maturity. This is why the Apostles were men who fasted and Paul said he was in fasting OFTEN in life.<br/> <br/>There is a FASTING saints that Jesus spoke of that produces a POWER in faith to withhold, push back, overpower the enemy in demonic forces and causes those who walk in such faith to set others free. IN Mt.17, on the Mt. of Transfiguration as we call it, please read what Jesus said about THIS KIND, not meaning demon, but THIS KIND of faith, comes only by PRAYER and FASTING. Saints, we live in a world where Satan is god and his people, the masses walk in temptations, flesh, lusts and seductions and those forces are INVISIBLE but set forth to deceive YOU and tempt YOU!! . WE are to overcome such a world, being IN it, not OF it, and we live in such a power when fasting is seriously taken in our hearts set forth for the Lord. Remember, when the god of THIS world tempted Jesus, HIS POWER, that is Jesus', was released because of denying FLESHLY WANTS and desires, and showing US, such power exists Hallelujah!!<br/> <br/>Even Paul shared by the Holy Spirit in I Cor.7, about the marriage covenant, the holiness in it and the strength of the relationship between a husband and wife, would be sanctified even more IN SPIRIT, by separating from the natural joining, to be completed in the SPIRITUAL joining. It brings the two into being ONE body, flesh, spirit, soul. Praise God. Fasting IS powerful saints and something we ALL OUGHT to long to learn more to do.<br/> <br/>Fasting is mentioned about 78 times in the Bible, 32 of which are in the New Testament.  Jesus, the Apostles, the disciples, Paul and the church lived a &#x201c;FASTED&#x201d; life saints. Paul was in fastings OFTEN in his life. Again, they LIVED a fasted life..  Not to get FROM God, but to give TO HIM. When we fast saints, WE give OUR life unto HIM.  Jesus did not say &#x201c;IF&#x201d; you fast, but &#x201c;WHEN&#x201d; you fast.  Fasting is so important in our spiritual lives while we wait for HIS appearing. Let the Holy Spirit teach you the beauty of fasting.  May your Spiritual eyes be enlightened to the immense and beautiful Spiritual life HE has set before you.<br/> <br/>FAST&#x2014;FASTING&#x2014;FASTED&#x2014;IS mentioned 78 times in the Bible, 32 of which are in the New Testament.  Please enjoy searching out the Word of God in this area and allow the Holy Spirit to help you learn the beautiful life associated with the clean heart in &#x201c;FASTING&#x201d; for the Lord&#x2014;(Jn. 16:13-14)<br/> <br/>Fast (24) times Old Testament&#x2014;6684 Strongs Concordance:<br/>II Sam.12:21,23  I Kings 21:9,12  II Chr.20:3  Ezra 8:21  Esther 4:16  Isa.58:1-14 Jer.14:12  36:9  Joel 1:14  2:15  Jonah 3:5  Zec.7:5  8:19<br/> <br/>Fast (17) times New Testament&#x2014;3522 Strongs Concordance<br/>Mt. 6:16,18  9:14-15  Mark 2:18-20  Lu.5:33-35  18:12  Acts 27:9, 33<br/> <br/>PLEASE TAKE NOTE:  Always remember to read the scriptures in context, which means to read a little before and after the quoted scriptures.  This way you can get a spiritual leading into what is being instructed to us and brings safety in learning the Word of God properly so nothing is taken out of context of which many do today.<br/> <br/>Fastest (1) New Testament  Mt. 6:17<br/> <br/>Fasted (12) Old Testament&#x2014;(3) New Testament<br/>Jgs.20:26  I Sam. 7:6  31:13  II Sam. 1:12  12:16,22  I Kings 21:27  I Chr.10:12  Ezra8:23  Neh.1:4  Isa.58:3--------------Mt.4:2  Acts 13:2,3<br/> <br/>Fastings (1) Old Testament&#x2014;(3) New Testament<br/>Esther 9:31  Lu.2:37  II Cor.6:5  11:27<br/> <br/>Fasting (9) Old Testament&#x2014;(8) New Testament<br/>Ne.9:1  Est.4:3  Ps.35:16  69:10  109:24  Dan.6:18 (2908 Strongs-only here)  Dan.9:3  Joel 2:12  Jer.36:6---------Mt. 15:32  17:21  Mark 8:3 9:29  Acts 10:30  14:23  27:33 <br/> <br/>I Cor.7:5 (marriage) Also read I Cor.9:27 where Paul talked about keeping his body in subjection to show the flesh who its master was, meaning the Spirit
