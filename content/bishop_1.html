		We will begin to look at an order of ministry today that is very rarely ever taught, spoken of or even put into proper perspective. First of all, when America lives with the mentality of &quot;Christianity&quot;, they have already gone astray from even understanding or embracing the Principles of the Kingdom of God.<br/><br/>First, please know saints that John the Baptist, the prophetic voice of Isaiah to prepare the hearts of people for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, preached the Kingdom of God. Jesus Christ preached the Kingdom of God. The Apostles and those SENT to the utter most parts of the earth preached the Kingdom of God. In fact, the Kingdom of God is mentioned over 150 times in the New Testament and &quot;Christianity&quot; is mentioned ZERO!<br/><br/>Today, Christianity is a conglomeration of over 250 different denominations and churches in America alone. Jesus said HE was the way, not ways. HE said he was the truth, not truths and HE was the life, not lifes. In John 10, Jesus said he was the DOOR, not doors. In other words there is but ONE way into salvation, the Kingdom and eternity. Jesus said MANY would go the way of destruction and very FEW would find the NARROW and STRAIGHT way into truth.<br/><br/>When one embraces the Kingdom of God, the first order embraced is that of Authority and Order. When you bring yourself into the subjection of HIS authority and HIS order, you begin to see the glory of HIS Kingdom. The first thing established in the earth with Jesus Christ was the foundation of the Government of God. With no government, there is no authority and with no authority, man becomes an authority unto himself.<br/><br/>Proverbs 16:25 <br/>There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. <br/><br/>Judges 17:6 <br/>In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes. <br/><br/>Notice that when there was NO king, no authority, no subjection to any, then men did what was right in their OWN eyes. Sadly, this is the heart of Christianity today. In the Kingdom of God though, ONLY Jesus Christ is exalted and ONLY Jesus Christ is lifted up. For this cause, in the New Testament, from the pouring forth of the Holy Spirit at Pentacost in Acts 2 onward, NOT ONE TIME is any flesh and blood exalted or lifted up. NOT ONE TIME is any man ever given a title and name to be called. <br/><br/>In other words, NO man is ever to be reverenced and thus never called &quot;Reverend&quot;. That is pure religion and defiles the hearts of God&#x2019;s people who are seduced into lifting men of God up in their own eyes. In the Kingdom of God, NOT ONE MAN was ever called by a title. Paul never had the name Apostle PRECEDE his name. It always followed after his calling as a servant. NOT ONE MAN was ever called &quot;Pastor&quot; in the Kingdom of God. In fact saints, the word Pastor does NOT Even exist in the New Testament Greek. The word found in Ephesians 4, is not Pastor in the Greek, but rather Shepherd. The word Poiman in the Greek is mentioned 16 times and NEVER one time is it named Pastor. <br/>

		<br/>This is why you can NOT find one man called Pastor anywhere in the New Testament. Amazing is it not? We have Senior Pastors, Associate Pastors, Youth Pastors and not one exists in the sight of God. The Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Shepherd and Teacher were NEVER titles, but rather functions of anointings these men of God as Elders in the faith were given. Paul was called Paul, NOT Pastor!!<br/><br/>For this cause, we have major problems today and much disobedience. IN religion we have &quot;Bishops&quot; who where robes, carry staffs and people bow before them. What indignation in the sight of our Holy God!!<br/><br/>The function of BISHOP is the foundation of this teaching. Let us go to the Word of God now and see with our very own eyes the truth. May you all be blessed.<br/><br/>THE BISHOP MINISTRY:<br/><br/><br/>BISHOP MINISTRY: This is an aspect of ministry that sometimes we as the children of God will not desire. The purpose is to take oversight through spiritual insight. Many times in the New Testament scriptures, the Apostles and Elders were continually instructed by the Holy Spirit to lead, guide and direct the Saints. This ministry is a God given gift, not for control, but protection. We can never step aside from the leading of the Holy Spirit, but what &quot;child&quot; knows the right way without instruction? Even our children will one day know what, when, where and why. This comes from oversight by parental cares and concerns. While one is yet young and tender in spirituals, they need mature wisdom and oversight. This is where the authority of God is given to those HE has chosen for this cause. Again, it is not for destruction or control, but for protection and to edify ones growth in the Holy things of God. We are called to NOT BE DECEIVED, and this is why there is &quot;SAFETY&quot; in the multitude of counselors. <br/><br/>First: We are called to never look back to where we have been.<br/><br/>Genesis 19:15-17, 26 Isaiah 30:1-10 Luke 9:62 John 6:66-67 Gal.3:1-3 <br/>Phil. 3:11-14 Col.1:7-12 <br/><br/>[15] And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. [16] And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. [17] And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. Genesis 19:15-17 [26] But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. <br/><br/>[30:1] Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin: [2] That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt! [3] Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion. [4] For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes. [5] They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach. [6] The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them. [7] For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still. [8] Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever: [9] That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the Lord: [10] Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits: Isaiah 30:1-10<br/><br/>Zoan&#x2014;Removal Hanes---Grace has fled<br/><br/>[62] And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. Luke 9:62<br/><br/>[66] From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. [67] Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? [68] Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. John 6:66-68<br/><br/>[3:1] O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? [2] This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? [3] Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? Galatians 3:1-3<br/><br/>[11] If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. [12] Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. [13] Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, [14] I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. [15] Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. [16] Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. [17] Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample. Philip. 3:11-17<br/><br/>[6] Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth: [7] As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; [8] Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. [9] For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; [10] That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; [11] Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness; [12] Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Col. 1:6-12<br/><br/>Eldership ministry will stand before you and be an example to you on how to follow after the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God. With this example comes wise counsel and Godly insight to protect one from deceptions and walking in error from truth.<br/><br/>Jer3:15 And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. <br/><br/>Eph.4:11-16 [11] And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; [12] For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: [13] Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: [14] That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; [15] But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: [16] From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. <br/><br/>[12] And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; [13] And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves. 1 Thes. 5:12-13<br/>

		<br/>[7] Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation. [8] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. [9] Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. Hebrews 13:7-9 <br/><br/>[17] Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you. Hebrews 13:17<br/><br/>A great burden and responsibility of Eldership ministry is to carry the hurts and pains of the people of God and to watch over them to keep them from wolves (false brethren) leaven (false doctrine) and seducing spirits (to lead one away from the flock). It is many times our soul man that causes us to make decisions that we feel the Lord has called us unto. Bishop ministry helps take oversight to this.<br/><br/>[2] Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 1 Peter 5:2<br/><br/>[28] Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. Acts 20:28<br/><br/>[25] For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. 1 Peter 2:25<br/><br/>episkopos, Greek 1985, Strong&#x2019;s episkopos, ep-is'-kop-os; from Greek 1909 (epi) and Greek 4649 (skopos) (in the sense of Greek 1983 (episkopeo)); a superintendent, i.e. Christian officer in general charge of a (or the) church (literal or figurative) :- bishop, overseer. skopos, Greek 4649, Strong&#x2019;s<br/>skopos, skop-os'; (&quot;scope&quot;); from skeptomai (to peer about [&quot;skeptic&quot;]; perhaps akin to Greek 4626 (skapto) through the idea of concealment; compare Greek 4629 (skepasma)); a watch (sentry or scout), i.e. (by implication) a goal :- mark.<br/><br/><br/>This is a very powerful word. The very purpose is to question the authenticity of every issue and line it to the Word of God. To be a watchman or sentry (a guard on duty) This office is the most misunderstood as well, for many misread and misjudge the heart of true Elders and say they are being controlled. I am sure this has sadly happened to some, but should never be the way it is suppose to be.<br/><br/>[3:1] This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. 1 Tim. 3:1<br/><br/>[25] But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: Proverbs 1:25<br/><br/>[30] They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. Proverbs 1:30<br/><br/>[14] Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. Proverbs 8:14<br/><br/>[14] Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety. Proverbs 11:14<br/><br/>[15] The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise. Proverbs 12:15<br/><br/>[22] Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established. Proverbs 15:22<br/><br/>[20] Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. [21] There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand. Proverbs 19:20-21<br/><br/>[5] Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out. Proverbs 20:5<br/><br/>ya`ats, Hebrew 3289, Strong&#x2019;s<br/>ya`ats, yaw-ats'; a primitive root; to advise; reflexive to deliberate or resolve :- advertise, take advice, advise (well), consult, (give, take) counsel (-lor), determine, devise, guide, purpose.<br/><br/>May we stand protected in this very hour of deception and apostasy. May we seek out wise counsel and trust in the authority of the Holy Spirit to lead us and guide us. Seek out those around you that have been ordained and called of God to watch over the flock. They are there because they care for you. Mr. Kim C.Gossett<br/><br/>
