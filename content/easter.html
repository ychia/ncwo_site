		Praise the Lord and God bless you all this day. May we again, learn the SPIRIT that is BEHIND Easter--Ishtar. Saints, we are called by God to be HOLY, God fearing, OBEDIENT children of God, to truth. With Easter coming up this weekend, we MUST stand on truth and NOT partake of such a heathen pagan celebration, even with unsaved family. I pray we DO fear God and I pray we DO NOT partake of such dinners, or celebrations, but remove ourselves and give witness to truth.<br/> <br/>Deut. 12:30-32<br/>    Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them (the heathen unbelievers), after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. [31] Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God: for every abomination to the Lord, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. [32] What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.<br/> <br/>Ephes. 5:8-16<br/>    For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: [9] (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) [10] Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. [11] And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. [12] For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. [13] But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. [14] Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. [15] See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, [16] Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.<br/> <br/>Ephes. 5:6<br/>    Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.<br/> <br/>Col. 3:6<br/>    For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:<br/> <br/>Easter is a day, that is honored  by nearly all of Christianity and is used to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Yet in the Kingdom of God, there is and NEVER was any such celebration!! Again, WHEN did the Apostles, who laid the foundation of the Kingdom of God in the Book of Acts, OR in the Epistles building discipline and Godly holiness and character, WHEN did they tell the saints, the church (God's people) to celebrate Easter?  They never did., WHEN were we as true children of LIGHT, taught to or told to observe the RESURRECTION?? Never saints!!  The holiday often involves a church service at sunrise, a feast which includes an &quot;Easter Ham&quot;, decorated eggs and stories about rabbits. What do bunny rabbits and eggs have to do EASTER or the resurrection of Jesus Christ? Absolutely nothing. In fact, Easter comes from the goddess ISHTAR (pronounced--EESH-TAR), who was a goddess of sexual fertility and offspring. Thus rabbits--known for procreation and eggs, meaning fertility were worhshipped. This is heathen, Pagan and antichrist. The Egyptians had their goddess called OESTER, same devil spirit of deception and the Babylonians had their ISHTAR, can you see the similarities of pagan nations? So where did such heathenism come from into Christian faith? Sadly, this all came by the way of Christianity, and all these pagan beliefs came from the Roman Catholic Church. Yet NO where is it founded in the Holy Word of God, by which we are TRULY SAVED and Born Again!! Those who love truth learn to ask questions, and many questions must be asked regarding the holiday of Easter. Jesus said, the TRUTH will make you free, so let's be free saints. Of course, the ONLY truth is the Word of God as Jesus said in John 17:17. Is it truly the day when Jesus arose from the dead? Is Easter REALLY a Holy day or Holiday unto our Father in heaven? Where did all of the strange customs come from, which have nothing to do with the resurrection of our Saviour?  Paul said in Philippians, he wanted to come to KNOW Jesus through the POWER of the resurrection (the Holy Spirit was that power) and fellowshipping with Jesus' sufferings--Phil.3:10. We are saved by the Blood of Jesus and our HOPE was IN the resurrection that we live resurrected lives, but NO WHERE was this a Holiday or celebration yearly. Our hope and life in knowing Jesus BY THE POWER of the resurrection is a DAILY LIFE we live, IN the Holy Ghost, crucify OUR flesh and carrying the cross DAILY. IT IS not a yearly celebration from Paganism.<br/> <br/>The first thing we must understand is that professing Christians in the Bible were DISCIPLES of Jesus Christ! Acts 11, says DISCIPLES of Jesus Christ, those God fearing, obeying, scripture living saints, THEY were Christians. Today, religion just says just believe in Jesus, but the Bible says, true CHRISTIANS FEAR God and OBEY HIM!! No where recorded anywhere in the New Covenant of God, the New Testament IN HIS BLOOD, did Christians observe, honor or celebrate something called &quot;Easter&quot;. IF not recorded, WHY do many do it today? They do it by deception, doctrines of devils, LIES and DECEIT. Some who know truth, do it by REBELLION and they no longer fear God, but THAT day IS coming, when they will tremble and wish to God, they had NOT hardened their hearts. True, Holy Ghost believers today, will NOT embrace, nor partake of such idolatry. Think of HOW many Church Pageants will be held. HOW many people will be emotionally MOVED, but NOT SPIRITUALLY strengthened. So many lies surround such man made doctrines. Jesus did NOT die on a Friday, yet all churches in Christianity will have GOOD FRIDAY services, celebrating a day, of which Jesus NEVER died on!!  You may say, but Easter IS in the Bible in Acts 12. Yes, go read it. It was NOT the Born Again, Kingdom of God Christians observing EASTER, it was Herod, the evil and pagan and wicked king who was observing it.<br/> <br/>&quot;Ishtar&quot;, which is pronounced &quot;Easter&quot; was a day that was honored and celebrated in Babylonian culture for the resurrection of one of their gods that they called &quot;Tammuz&quot;, who was believed to be the only begotten son of the moon-goddess and the sun-god. In those ancient times, there was a man named Nimrod, who was the grandson of one of Noah's son's, named Ham. This Ham had a son named Cush who married a woman named Semiramis. Cush and Semiramis then had a son and named him &quot;Nimrod.&quot; After the death of his father, Nimrod married his own mother and became a powerful king. The Bible tells of of this man, Nimrod, in Genesis 10:8-10 as follows: &quot;And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.<br/> <br/>Nimrod became a god-man to the people and Semiramis, his wife and mother, became the powerful Queen of ancient Babylon. It was this spirit of Baal worship, that brought in the Babylonian culture of ancient goddess worship, and eventually she became known as the Queen of Heaven, the very spirit Jeremiah the Prophet condemned. In Jeremiah they were burning incense unto the Queen of Heaven, just like Roman Catholics burn candles and incense unto statues of Mary. Such paganism saints and abominations to God. It was from Semiramis worship that the Church in Rome to this day, The Roman Catholic Church, has holy water, the worship of the Queen of Heaven, whom they call Mary now, and when Catholics cross themselves, it was NOT from the sign of the CROSS of Jesus Christ, but in Babylonian days, worshippers of Semiramis as Queen of Heaven and her son, TAMMUZ, whom Ezekiel condemns, they would walk past each other giving the sign of the &quot;T&quot;, as Tammuz worshippers. PLEASE see this abomination in the SPIRIT saints and realize what darkness of idolatry is behind it.<br/> <br/>In Babylonian belief, when Nimrod was killed by his enemies, his body was cut in pieces and strewn through his kingdom. Semiramis had all of the parts gathered, except for one part that could not be found. That missing part was his reproductive organ. Semiramis claimed that Nimrod could not come back to life without it and told the people of Babylon that Nimrod had ascended to the sun and was now to be called &quot;Baal&quot;, the sun god. Queen Semiramis also proclaimed that Baal would be present on earth in the form of a flame, whether candle or lamp. This is why in the church of Rome, in Catholic churches today, there are SO many candles lit!! This is why they pay, LIGHT A CANDLE at the feet of the statues of the Queen of Heaven, Mary!!  Semiramis was creating a mystery religion, and with the help of Satan, she set herself up as a goddess. Semiramis claimed that she was immaculately conceived. In places like Guatemala AND in Mexico AND in the Philippines, many proclaim that Mary herself was immaculately conceived without sin as well. NOT just that Jesus was born of a virgin, but MARY herself was born of God by a virgin, thus Mary the Immaculate!! Or the Immaculate Conception, which does not just pertain to Jesus Christ, but to MARY herself. This is why Rome, worships MARY, and says she is the Co-Redeemer without sin herself!! When Pope John Paul II was shot in the 1980's, he said MARY SAVED HIS LIFE and this is why before he died, Pope John Paul wanted the Vatican to appoint Mary as CO-Redeemer. This ALL came from Babylonian worship, AND Easter comes from ISHTAR,, The Queen of Heaven, Semiramis.<br/> <br/>All of Roman Church Doctrine comes from Babylonian Culture! Now Semiramis, she taught that the moon was a goddess that went through a 28 day cycle and ovulated when full. She further claimed that she came down from the moon in a giant moon egg that fell into the Euphrates River. This was to have happened at the time of the first full moon after the spring equinox. This is why EASTER every year, is set as a date by the Spring Equinox, and after the FIRST Full moon. Semiramis became known as &quot;Ishtar&quot; which is pronounced &quot;Easter&quot;, and her moon egg became known as &quot;Ishtar's&quot; egg.&quot; Ishtar soon became pregnant and claimed that it was the rays of the sun-god Baal that caused her to conceive. The son that she brought forth was named Tammuz. Tammuz was noted to be especially fond of rabbits, and they became sacred in the ancient religion, for their fertility and because Tammuz was believed to be the son of the sun-god, Baal. Tammuz, like his supposed father, became a hunter. The day came when Tammuz was killed by a wild pig, that the Queen of Heaven, Semiramis, got water from a spring and threw it on her son Tammuz who came back to life, was resurrected from the dead  and thus HOLY WATER sprinklings in the Catholic church to THIS day. This is why people walk in a Catholic church, touch their holy water, and CROSS THEMSELVES and then bow on one knee before statues of IDOLATRY. This crossing themselves again, It came from &quot;T&quot; for Tammuz, but most Catholics have NO idea.<br/> <br/>Queen Ishtar told the people that Tammuz was now ascended to his father, Baal, and that the two of them would be with the worshippers in the sacred candle or lamp flame as Father, Son and Spirit. Ishtar, who was now worshipped as the &quot;Mother of God and Queen of Heaven&quot;, continued to build her mystery religion. Saints, I pray you can SEE more and more the depth of how Satan himself built this Mystery Religion of old, then brought it into Christianity as the Roman Catholic Church. BUT no where was this founded in the Kingdom of God, thus, NO where in the Bible!! The queen told the worshippers that when Tammuz was killed by the wild pig, some of his blood fell on the stump of an evergreen tree, and the stump grew into a full new tree overnight. This made the evergreen tree sacred by the blood of Tammuz. This is also why EVERGREEN trees are used as idolatry and today in Christ-MASS celebrations for Jesus' birth, yet again, NO where in Scripture and, all from the Roman Church. Ishtar--Semiramis,  also proclaimed a forty day period of time of sorrow each year prior to the anniversary of the death of Tammuz. During this time, no meat was to be eaten. Worshippers were to meditate upon the sacred mysteries of Baal and Tammuz, and to make the sign of the &quot;T&quot; in front of their hearts as they worshipped. They also ate sacred cakes with the marking of a &quot;T&quot; or cross on the top. This today is the 40 days of LENT. These 40 days PRECEDE the advent of Easter. Every year, on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox, a celebration was made. It was Ishtar's Sunday and was celebrated with rabbits and eggs, BOTH worshipped for reproduction. Ishtar also proclaimed that because Tammuz was killed by a pig, that a pig must be eaten on that Sunday. This is why MOST have Easter HAMS to this day saint. Can YOU SEE this saints? This is where Easter HAMS come from, the eating of pork, which we know God condemned in the Old Testament. So, EVERYTHING leading up to Easter each year, came from heathen pagan rituals, and Babylon and today we have what we have from the Roman Church. I pray you are ALL free today by truth.<br/> <br/>This paganism has infiltrated the true&quot;Christian&quot; churches, over the centuries, and this paganism came in by way of the Roman Catholic System. The truth is that Easter has nothing whatsoever to do with the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Resurrection of Jesus is NOT a HOLY DAY OR a HOLIDAY, which is what the word derives from. The Resurrection of Jesus Christ, to BORN AGAIN Kingdom Children, is a LIFESTYLE!!!!!!!!!  We live daily the resurrected life!!!! . Again, there are some who may wonder why the word &quot;Easter&quot; is in the the King James Bible. It is because Acts, chapter 12, tells us that it was the evil  pagan King Herod, who was planning to celebrate Easter, and not the Born Again, Christians.We know that the Bible tells us in John 4:24, &quot;God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.&quot; The truth is that the forty days of Lent, eggs, rabbits, and the Easter ham have everything to do with the ancient pagan religion of Mystery Babylon, yet NOTHING to do with Jesus Christ and his Kingdom. This is the foundation of the church in Rome and why in Revelation 17, there is an antichrist religious system known as MYSTERY BABYLON, the Great, the MOTHER OF HARLOTS and the ABOMINATION in all the earth. These are all antichrist activities!  Satan is a master deceiver, and has filled the lives of well-meaning, professing Christians with idolatry.These things bring the wrath of God upon children of disobedience--Eph.5 and Colossians 3, who try to make pagan customs of Baal worship into something Christian. You must answer for your activities and for what you teach your children. These customs of Easter honor Baal, who is also Satan, and is still worshipped as the &quot;Rising Sun&quot; and his house is the &quot;House of the Rising Sun.&quot;<br/> <br/>Saints, there are VERY SERIOUS issues of Pagan worship and God FORBID, yes GOD FORBID any true Born Again believers would partake. DO NOT saints, be partakers with the unfruitful works of darkness!! DO not attend Easter dinners with your unsaved family members, DO NOT partake of ANY Baal worship, for Satan IS the spirit behind ISHTAR--EASTER.  Brother Kim<br/> <br/>
