		But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.  - 2Co 11:3-4<br/>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. - 2Co 11:12-15<br/>Introduction<br/><br/>Paul warned us of another Jesus, another Spirit, and another gospel that would be preached, received, and believed. Did you hear these scriptures? People would appear to be the ministers of righteousness and they would preach Jesus, but it would be another Jesus and it would produce an altered and strange gospel. It would bring forth a different spirit. It would not be the Jesus recorded for us in the Bible. They would preach a gospel of Jesus Christ but it would be a different gospel than that is recorded for us in the Bible. These people would disguise themselves as the apostles of Christ. The Jesus only movement claims to be apostolic, but we shall see it is in fact apostate. They have departed from the true faith which was once for all delivered unto us by the apostles of the Lord Jesus.<br/>Probably the one reference that will deal with more issues than any other is the following. Let this be a sort of outline for us. [I have added numbers for each of the points.]<br/>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, [1] The Son can do [2] nothing of himself, but what he [3] seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, [4] these also doeth the Son likewise. For the Father [5] loveth the Son, and [6] sheweth him all things that [7] himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; [8] even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath [9] committed all judgment unto the Son: That all men [10] should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father [11] which hath sent him.  &#x2013; John 5:19-23<br/>The following will all prove that Jesus and the Father are NOT the same person:<br/>1.      Jesus identifies himself as The Son showing his relationship to God the Father<br/>2.      Nothing Jesus did was of himself meaning he chose not to do his own will, but was commissioned by his Father<br/>3.      Jesus is able to observe independently what his heavenly Father is doing<br/>4.      Jesus does what he sees the Father doing, hence the Son&#x2019;s actions are independent of the Father&#x2019;s<br/>5.      The Father loves the Son. The word &#x2018;love&#x2019; here is in the Greek phileo and means &#x201c;to be a friend to i.e. fond of an individual&#x201d;. This is not a self-love, but affection that one has for another person.<br/>6.      The Father shows the Son what He is doing.<br/>7.      The Father&#x2019;s actions are separated from the Son&#x2019;s actions.<br/>8.      The Son has an independent will showing they are different persons.<br/>9.      The Father committed all judgment to the Son. Thus, it was his and he delegated to the Son. If the Father were the Son then even if he committed it to him, the Father would still be judging all men.<br/>10.  Men may honor the Father and yet not honor the Son because they are two separate persons.<br/>11.  The whole mission of Jesus was in being sent by his Father. Jesus did not send himself.<br/>A.                The Importance of the Trinity<br/><br/>The doctrine of the trinity affects how we understand God and his purposes for creating us, His love, His unity, and most especially Jesus&#x2019; example of submission and obedience. In fact we can only truly under&#x00ad;stand what it is to be a disciple of the Lord if we under&#x00ad;stand the truth of the trinity. Without the truth of the trinity, the primary requirement of discipleship to deny oneself take up one&#x2019;s cross and follow Jesus would not mean anything. The laying down of one&#x2019;s own will to do the will of another is at the very core of true Biblical discipleship. What example could Jesus have left us if he were the Father? Would not in all truth he be doing his own will? Then why the struggle in the garden before his crucifixion (Lk 22:42) to not do his will but the will of his Father? If he was the Father and the Father&#x2019;s will was his very own? If Jesus were already the Father, then there could be no struggle to do the Father&#x2019;s will for it would have been his own already! Thus, the very struggle of Jesus in the garden to lay down his will and do the Father&#x2019;s will (i.e. not my will be done but thine) can only be if the Father and Jesus are two distinct persons.<br/>

		Thus, we see Jesus and the Father had their own separate wills. In fact everything that makes two people two people is what we see between the Father and Jesus. They not only had their own will they also had their own separate knowledge of what they knew: &#x201c;But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.&#x201d; Mark 13:32  Now let no one deceive you friend, Jesus was fully God while he was here on this earth and though he knew all things, yet he did not know what was in his Father&#x2019;s heart as to when the Father would send him back for the second coming.<br/>

		
		Daniel shows us that Son of man and the Ancient of Days are two different persons. The Son of man is clearly Jesus who received an everlasting kingdom from his Father, who is the Ancient of Days.<br/>13I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. 14And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. Daniel 7:13-14<br/>The true church will have the revelation from the Father that Jesus is the Christ (the anointed one from the Father) and that he is not the same as God himself but rather the Son of the living God. Sadly Jesus only&#x2019;ers do not have this divine revelation and though they may think they are the only true church by the Bible itself they are in reality a false church, and one which Jesus has NOT built for they do not even have this simple revelation.<br/>16And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 17And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. 18And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Mt 16:16-18<br/>A.                Two or Three Witnesses<br/><br/>Is the trinity taught in the Bible? Yes! &#x201c;For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.&#x201d; 1 John 5:7-8  This could not be any simpler there are three that are one NOT as in the same or identical, but ONE in witness, one in agree&#x00ad;ment. That is the trinity. Sadly, Oneness people completely twist this verse to say the opposite of what it is saying. Clearly, from the context the Spirit, the water, and the blood are not one as in the same or identical, but again one in agreement.<br/>This is required in order to bear reliable witness. We must have 2 or 3 witnesses! Forget not the principle of witness: &#x201c;at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be estab&#x00ad;lished.&#x201d; This principle is established many times in the scripture (Dt 19:15, 17:6, Mt 18:16, 1Tim 5:19, Heb 10:28). Thus, for a matter to be established there must be two or three independent witnesses. If God the Father and His Son Jesus are not two persons, neither can they be two witnesses.  It is clearly seen from John 8:16-18 by Jesus&#x2019; own words that He and the Father are two separate persons.  Together with the Holy Spirit the three are one.<br/>A matter cannot be established by one giving their testimony, leaving the room putting on a different face or mask and then returning to give the same or corroborating testimony. NO! The eyewitnesses must be separate individuals whom you notice each have their own mouth. Thus, if Jesus is the Father, and Jesus is the Son, and Jesus is the Spirit we have only one witness, which even by Jesus&#x2019; own words this would make his witness invalid by his own laws.<br/>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. - John 8:16-18<br/>Jesus made clear that even as John was a separate witness to Jesus so was his heavenly Father, proving again that the heavenly Father is required to be a separate person of the godhead:<br/>Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. &#x2026; But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. - John 5:33-37<br/>Please note the specific testimony or record that the Father has borne is in particularly of His Son. That the true life is not in Jesus only, but in the Son.<br/>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. -1 John 5:9-11<br/>B.                 Is the Trinity taught in the Bible?<br/><br/>Here are some other clear references to the trinity. Notice in each of these how we see the Father, the Son, and the Spirit each doing their unique part to accomplish the whole:<br/>&quot;But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I [Jesus] have said unto you.&quot; &#x2013; Jn 14:26<br/>For through him [Christ Jesus] we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. &#x2013; Eph 2:18<br/>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? &#x2013; Heb 9:14<br/><br/>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied. &#x2013; 1Pe 1:2<br/><br/>For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: &#x2013; 1Pe 3:18<br/>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. &#x2013; Luke 1:35<br/>For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. &#x2013; John 3:34<br/>This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. &#x2013; Acts 2:32-33<br/>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: Eph 1:17<br/>There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.  &#x2013; Ephesians 4:4-6<br/>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied. &#x2013; 1 Peter 1:2<br/>The Bible speaks of his Godhead which is in reference to his joint rule and of his essence as God. Interestingly it refers to this exactly 3 times (Acts 17:29; Rom 1:20; Col 2:9).<br/>C.                 Where art thou God?<br/><br/>Jesus only&#x2019;ers state Jesus is the Father. Thus, when Jesus was incarnated and came to earth there would be NO ONE sitting on the throne in heaven. Yet, Jesus himself constantly rejected this. Note where Jesus said the Father was: &#x201c;in heaven&#x201d; even while he was on the earth.<br/>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. Mt 16:17<br/>And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth. Luke 11:2<br/>Let us examine now the extended description of Jesus in Hebrews 1 which relates him to the Father. We will see many evidences that Jesus and the heavenly Father are two distinct persons, but both God.<br/>1God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, 2Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; 3Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; 4Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. 5For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? 6And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. &#x2026; But to which of the angels said he at any times, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy foot&#x00ad;stool?  Heb 1:1-6,13<br/>First, note that God appointed his Son heir of all things. Remember what an heir is: one who succeeds, or is to succeed another and to receive their possessions and rights. Jesus was appointed the heir. One cannot appoint themselves an heir, nor would one need to. So here we have yet another proof that God the Father is separate and distinct from his Son Jesus.<br/>D.                Who is at the right hand of God?<br/><br/>Second, note that the Son after he had purged our sins did not sit down on the throne of Majesty on high, but rather on the right hand of the throne of Majesty on high. &#x201c;Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;&#x201d; Heb 8:1. Jesus is not the Father as evidenced by the fact that he did not sit down in the Father&#x2019;s throne, but rather on the right hand of the throne. The Godhead does not play musical chairs. The Father has his throne and Jesus has his throne.<br/>&#x201c;the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power&#x201d; &#x2013; Mt 26.64/Mk 14:62/Lk 22:69<br/>&#x201c;So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.&#x201d;&#x2013; Mk 16:19<br/>&#x201c;Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.&#x201d; &#x2013; Col 3:1<br/>&#x201c;But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;&#x201d; &#x2013; Heb 10:12<br/>Everywhere this distinction is maintained: by Jesus and by the apostles, before his ascension and after. You must ask why? Simply because they are two separate persons of the godhead with two separate thrones. You cannot make them one without doing violence to the scriptures. Also in regard to sitting down at the right hand of God we see the awesome accuracy of the King James Bible. Jesus himself quotes from Psalm 110:1. Let us look at this quote in which we see the LORD (the Hebrew word &#x2018;Jehovah&#x2019; in all capitals refers to the Father) speaking unto David&#x2019;s Lord (the Hebrew word &#x2018;Adonai&#x2019; referring to the son of God, Jesus). The Greek does not carry this distinction for us between LORD (all capitals) and Lord (small letters). Yet the New Testament in English records for us this distinction exactly where and when we need it so that there should be no confusion. Three times this phrase &#x201c;The LORD&#x201d; (all capitals) is used. Each of these times it is in reference to this same verse in Psalm 110:1.<br/>A Psalm of David. The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. Psalm 110:1<br/>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The Son of David. He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? Mt 22:41-44<br/>And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, Till I make thine enemies thy footstool. David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son? Luke 20:42-44<br/>For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, Until I make thy foes thy footstool. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Acts 2:34-36<br/>Let there be no mistake in understanding. David wrote this Psalm by the Holy Ghost and he is recording what he experienced spiritually when the LORD (i.e. Father God) spoke to his Lord. His Lord is the one who would sit at the right hand of God, whom God would make his enemies his footstool. Thus, even in heaven we have the Father and the Son as two distinct persons, sitting on two distinct thrones, speaking to one another as two distinct persons. So apparently even God believes in the trinity for out of His own mouth is spoken the words &#x201c;I&#x201d; and &#x201c;thou&#x201d;. Remember these are NOT David&#x2019;s interpre&#x00ad;tation or limited viewpoint, but what he was divinely instructed to write by God himself. Thus, these are the very words of God: &#x201c;I&#x201d; and &#x201c;thou&#x201d;.<br/>Sadly, these same verses in Acts 2 are twisted by Jesus only preachers to supposedly say that God made Jesus the Father when it says &#x201c;God hath made that same Jesus &#x2026; both Lord and Christ. Thank God for the Bible which shows the false doctrine of men and reveals that their only purpose is not to hear the truth but to persuade and entrap others with their cultic views. Note that the Bible does not say that God made Jesus LORD (all capitals) but Lord (small capitals) and that we can be sure that this is truth for in the English itself verse 34 of Acts 2 shows the distinction between LORD (all capitals) and Lord (small capitals). Thus, God made Jesus Lord (small capitals), not LORD (all capitals). So what does it mean that God made Jesus &#x201c;Lord&#x201d; (small capitals) just that he is &#x201c;our Lord&#x201d; as the scripture says 80x (e.g.: his Son [His relationship] Jesus Christ our Lord [our relationship] &#x2013; Rom 1:3, 1Co 1:9, 1Jn 1:3, 3:23, 5:20)!<br/>

		<img style="margin: 10px; display: block; float: right;" src="img/lampstand.png"/>

		This then is how we can understand why Jesus himself asks the question &#x201c;What think ye of Christ? whose son is he?&#x201d; Or even more forcefully as he says in Mark&#x2019;s gospel: &#x201c;And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?&#x201d; Mark 12:35-37 The answer that Jesus was looking for if you read the passage is NOT the son of David. What Jesus wanted them to see that Christ was the son of God!<br/>E.                 How many is us?<br/><br/>Jesus only people clearly do not understand English. What does the word &#x2018;us&#x2019; mean? Simply, me and others. The smallest number &#x2018;us&#x2019; can be is two. But in all of the following verses we see God is not one but &#x2018;us&#x2019;, that is, more than one.<br/>&quot;If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.&quot; - Jn 14:23<br/>And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: Gen 3:22<br/>And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. &#x2013; Gen 11:6-7<br/>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness &#x2026; So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. &#x2013; Gen 1:26-27<br/>This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; Gen 5:1<br/>I have seen the strangest twistings of these obvious verses where the Godhead, that is the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, were all clearly involved in the creation of man contrary to what Jesus only doctrine states. And no the &#x2018;us&#x2019; here absolutely cannot be the angels, for several reasons. First, God alone created the heavens and the earth and all that is in them without any help from the angels. Please do not forget that the angels are part of the creation. He did not need, nor did he obtain, any help from the angels.<br/>Secondly, we are not made in the image of the angels, but in the image of God. &#x201c;Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.&#x201d; (James 3:9) The Bible is quite clear that the image of God and the image of angels are completely different. &#x201c;For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.&#x201d; Heb 2:16  Did you hear that? Jesus did NOT take upon him the nature or image of angels, but he took on the nature or image of man. Man was made in the image and glory of God (1Co 11:7, Gen 1:26-27).Thus, the scripture says Jesus was the express image of the person of God (Heb 1:1-3), and Jesus is the image of God (2Co 4:4, Col 1:15).<br/>Similarly we see in the following verses the Lord himself making a clear distinction between one member of the Godhead and another. Notice in John 14:16 Jesus states that the Father will give us another counselor, a clear distinction between Jesus and the Holy Spirit. They are two different counselors. The Greek word for &#x2018;another&#x2019; is allos which means different.<br/>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, &amp; shall be in you. Jn 14:16-17<br/>F.                  Where is God?<br/><br/>People so often forget when Jesus was here on earth that he was not only man, but also God in the flesh. &#x201c;For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.&#x201d; Col 1:19, 2:9  Thus, we see all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in Christ Jesus. Thus, when he was here on the earth, even as now in heaven, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in him. If Jesus were the Father and the Spirit, AND all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in him, then when he was here on earth there could be no one on the throne in heaven. Yet we see God continually on the throne, before Jesus&#x2019; incarnation, during Jesus&#x2019; life here on earth, and after Jesus ascends into heaven to sit at the right hand of God.<br/>If Jesus were the Father, then after the resurrection the scripture would have to say &#x201c;Jesus our Father&#x201d;, but on the contrary it always makes a distinguishing between the two as the following verse shows:<br/>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, 2The 2:16<br/>Note: it was never &#x201c;our Father which was in heaven&#x201d; which is what Jesus would have to say if he were the Father and he was not now in heaven, but here on earth. Nor does it ever say &#x201c;our Father which will be in heaven&#x201d;. No, the scripture always says &#x201c;our Father which is in heaven&#x201d;. In fact this is recorded 20x: Mt 5:16,45,48, 6:1,9, 7:11,21, 10:32-33, 12:50, 16:17, 18:10,14,19, 23:9, 24:36, Mk 11:25-26, 13:32; Lk 11:2. Out of all these verses note in particular these which clearly show that while Jesus was in the earth that the Father was still in heaven<br/>Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. Mt 18:10<br/>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. Matthew 16:17<br/>G.                Who&#x2019;s Talking to Whom?<br/><br/>Jesus only people must believe Jesus is the great ventriloquist and schizophrenic. For he talks to himself and he answers himself often from heaven. Are these voices from heaven just Jesus talking to himself as the Jesus only people say, projecting his voice from the clouds? [Note: to do this would be deliberately deceptive, which we must therefore absolutely reject, for Jesus is the very embodiment of truth.] If one believes Jesus only doctrine they make Jesus truly schizophrenic.<br/>Several times during Jesus&#x2019; ministry here on earth the heavenly Father spoke from heaven. What is unique is in each and every one of them the voice that speaks (1) establishes that God and Jesus are two different people, (2) identifies Jesus as the Son of God, and (3) glorifies Jesus not as God or as Jesus only, but as the Son of God who should be honored and obeyed as the representative of the Father. Sadly, Jesus onlyer&#x2019;s are so corrupted by the false doctrine of Jesus only that they cannot hear the Word of God in any of these occurrences. Truly then they do not know the Son or the Father whom he was sent by the Father to reveal.<br/>a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Mt 3:17/Mk 1:11/Lk 3:22<br/>behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. Mt 17:5/Mk 9:7/Lk9:35<br/>Jesus&#x2019; prayers and the Father&#x2019;s voice from heaven ONLY makes sense if they are each talking to another separate and distinct person. It is impossible to come to any other conclusion if one honestly reads John 17 which is Jesus&#x2019; high priestly prayer to his heavenly Father. Just a sampling of phrases from that prayer should show the honest seeker the truth of Jesus and the Father being two separate individuals: &#x201c;thou hast given him&#x201d;/&#x201c;thou gavest me&#x201d; (11x), &amp; &#x201c;glorify thou me with thine own self&#x201d; (glory: 4x).<br/>Let us look at yet some more scriptures to show that the scripture demands the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit to be separate persons of the godhead. The Spirit&#x2019;s Role cannot be understood if He is the Father or the Son. For instance Jesus says, &#x201c;as the Father has said unto me&#x201d; (Jn 12:49-50).<br/>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you. &#x2013; John 16:13-15<br/>Notice that the Spirit of God is listening to someone else speak and that is clearly not himself. He will speak what he hears not what he speaks. Thus, the verse in John 16:13 shows us (1) that the Spirit of God will only speak what he hears from Jesus, and (2) that the Spirit will not speak of himself. Clearly then, the Spirit did not speak to himself otherwise what he speaks would be &#x201c;of himself&#x201d;. This proves beyond a reasonable shadow of doubt if you believe the scriptures and not what any man says that Jesus is not the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is not Jesus. They are required to be two separate persons of the godhead. <br/>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. &#x2013; Matthew 3:16-17<br/>Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. John 12:28<br/>At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. &#x2013; Mt 11:25<br/>Even in heaven we see still the Father and the Son as separate persons of the trinity.<br/>Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. Matthew 10:32-3<br/>H.                One, but Different<br/><br/>If Jesus is the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost as Jesus only cultists teach, then Jesus must be equal to the Father in all respects. Jesus declares to us &#x201c;my Father is greater than I.&#x201d; (Jn 14:28) Yet when we see the scripture we see though he is one with the Father in essence as God, he is yet different as a son is to his father. Though a mature, fully devoted, and loving son who knows the heart and will of his father because of his intimacy, they yet have their own indepen&#x00ad;dent minds and wills. If Jesus were the Father, this would not be the case for they would be one and the same. Let us now look at the differences between Jesus and the heavenly Father.<br/>Though Jesus claimed to be God and to fully represent his Father, yet he never claimed to be in fact the Father. NEVER! Nor does the scripture ever state that he was the Father. The scripture, as this next verse proves, shows that Jesus and the Father had different minds and different knowledge, for the Father knew when he would send the Son, but the Son did not know when that was. How can the Son not know what the Father knows if they are one and the same? Remember, God cannot deny himself.<br/>But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Mark 13:32<br/>Let us look at the distinct differences between Jesus the Son and God the Father. Here then is a summary of those things which prove God the Father and Jesus the Son are two different persons, for each of these things the Father and the Son have different:<br/>.    their sanctification &#x2013; Jesus sanctified himself (the Father has no need of this), Jn 10:36, 17:10<br/>.    their possessions &#x2013; the Father had to give them to Jesus, Mt 11:27, Lk 1:32, Jn 3:35<br/>.    their forgiveness &#x2013; Jesus prays the Father forgive them when Jesus already has, Lk 23:34<br/>.    their knowledge &#x2013; each as their own separate knowledge, Mk 13:32<br/>.    their subjection &#x2013; the Father is subject to no one, but Jesus is subject to the Father, 1Co 15:28<br/>.    their pleasure &#x2013; Jesus chose not to please himself but to please his Father, Jn 8:29<br/>.    their doctrine &#x2013; Jn 7:17-18<br/>.    their witness &#x2013; each has their own witness to give, Jn 8:18, 1Jn 5:9-11 (of His Son!)<br/>.    their speech &#x2013; Jesus did not speak of [i.e. &#x2018;from&#x2019;] himself, Jn 12:49-50<br/>.    their giving &#x2013; the Father gave Jesus power, men, words, Jn 17.2,6-9,11-12,24, 3:35, 5:25-27<br/>.    their power &#x2013; each has their own power, Acts 1:7<br/>.    their works &#x2013; Jn 5:36-37, 17:4<br/>.    their honor &#x2013; they may be honored differently, Jn 5:23, 8:54<br/>.    their glory &#x2013; each has their own glory, Jn 7:17-18, 17:1,22,24, Mt 19:28, 25:31, 2Pe 1:17<br/>.    their will &#x2013; each has their own separate will, Jn 5:30, 6:40, Mt 26:39,42<br/>These are the very essences of personhood, one&#x2019;s own will, what one knows and has, the work they do, what they speak. The scripture mandates every where that the Father and the Son be two different persons. This should be acknowledged by any who have read the gospels concerning Jesus&#x2019; will. Jesus of his own free will continually denied his own will and subjugated it to the will of his Father. The struggle in the garden of Gethsemane is over whose will to do. This proves they have two different independent wills, and this by itself is enough to establish their distinct personhoods. The Bible is abundantly clear on this point. Jesus did not do his own will. Jesus did not please himself, but rather always did those things which please his heavenly Father.<br/>Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. John 8:28-29<br/>If Jesus were the Father, then from John 8:28-29 Jesus always did those things that please himself! There would have been no self-denial at all and no example for us as how to live as disciples. But the scripture says this is not so. For Jesus did NOT please himself.<br/>We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification. For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me. Rom 15:1-3<br/>Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. Jesus answered, If I honour myself [which he clearly didn&#x2019;t], my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: &#x2013; John 8:49,54<br/>I.                   Even As &#x2013; Understanding the Comparisons<br/><br/>Jesus himself lets us know what he means by the comparisons he makes with his heavenly Father by repeatedly making those same comparisons between his faithful disciples and himself. Jesus tells us that we are to honor the Son even as the Father. &#x201c;That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.&#x201d; &#x2013; Jn 5:23  Thus, it is possible to honor the Father and not to honor the Son. Hence, they must be different.<br/>The same principle of comparison is evidenced in the Father&#x2019;s love for Jesus and the Father&#x2019;s love for us. The Father&#x2019;s love toward Jesus is NOT a self-love, but a love of devotion toward another. We remain in Jesus&#x2019; love if we keep his commandments. This is exactly how Jesus abided in the Father&#x2019;s love by keeping his Father&#x2019;s commandments. We do not keep our will, but another&#x2019;s will (i.e. Jesus&#x2019; will). Jesus did not keep his will, but another&#x2019;s will (i.e. the Father&#x2019;s will).<br/>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. John 15:10<br/>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. &#x2026; And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them John 17:23,26<br/>Ownership works the same. The Bible says, &#x201c;And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.&#x201d; 1Co 3:23 Even as we belong to Christ, so Christ belongs to the Father God. Though we are members of Christ&#x2019;s body and one with him in spirit (and in many other ways), yet we are still distinct individuals each with our own will, thoughts, and personality. Even so it is with Christ and the Father.<br/>[Note: We will see this same truth again in the next two sections concerning (1) the oneness of the Father &amp; the Son and (2) as Jesus was sent by the Father, even so Jesus sent his disciples.]<br/>J.                   What is the Oneness that Jesus and the Father have?<br/><br/>Jesus only people love to take John 10:30 to supposedly prove that the Father and Jesus are the same person. It says, &#x201c;I and my Father are one.&#x201d; John 10:30  But let us examine what Jesus means by &#x2018;one&#x2019;. Does it as the Jesus only people claim that they are one and the same? No, that would be a clear distortion of the word of God. For Jesus uses this same word one in relationship to our unity with God. Note: the bolded words &#x2018;one&#x2019; in these verses are all the same word in the Greek.<br/>And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. &#x2026; That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: John 17:11,21-22<br/>Now, are we one with the Father? Yes, according to both John 17:11,21-22. And is this oneness that we have with the Father the same as the oneness that Jesus has with the Father? Yes, exactly (even as)! Jesus said &#x201c;that they may be one, as we are.&#x201d; The oneness we have with the Father and Jesus is IDENTICAL to the oneness that Jesus has with the Father. Yet we are clearly NOT the same person as God himself.<br/>It is clearly in all three verses a unity issue not a singular identity issue. Jesus said, &#x201c;At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.&#x201d; &#x2013; John 14:20  This is our oneness, a oneness of unity. The same way Jesus is in the Father, is the same way we are in Jesus. We do not cease to exist as individuals when we are born again. We are individual members of his body. This is the great and serious misunder&#x00ad;standing of the Jesus onlyers. Thus, to take John 10:30 and make it say that Jesus and the Father are the same person is a clear twisting of the scripture and heresy, for it is not in line with the whole record of scripture.<br/>K.                Who Sent Who?<br/>



		<br/>Jesus declares over and over again he was sent by the Father (John 5:23,30,36-37, 6:44,57, 7:28-29, 8:16,18,29,42, 10:36, 12:49, 17:21,25, 20:21; 1Jn 4:14). He never once states that he sent himself. Jesus always shows himself as one who is under authority. In fact the sent ministry always demands two or more. Biblically no one ever sends themselves. They must always be commis&#x00ad;sioned by another.<br/>Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me. Isaiah 48:16 [Notice: he was sent by the Lord GOD and by his Spirit.]<br/>Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. &#x2013; John 8:42-43<br/>Can we hear his word today? It cannot really be any clearer: &#x201c;he sent me&#x201d;. Jesus did not send himself. He was sent by another. In fact, the same way Jesus was sent by his Father is the same way we, as his disciples, are sent by Jesus. Notice,<br/>Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. &#x2013; Jn 20:21<br/>If we do not understand that the Father (a separate person from the Son) sent his only begotten Son, then as Jesus told us it clearly indicates we do not know the Father. Sadly this is so true of the Jesus onlyers: they do not know their Father! Unfortunately, this makes the Jesus onlyers bastards (Heb 12:8), for a bastard has a father, they just don&#x2019;t know who it their father is.<br/>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. &#x2013; John 7:28<br/>L.                 Of Whose Self?<br/><br/>The following verses all show that Jesus CANNOT be the Father. In each of these verses Jesus clearly distinguishes between doing something of himself (which he could have done) versus those things which we choose to do that were instead of his Father rather than his own will:<br/>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. &#x2013; John 7:17-18<br/>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. &#x2013; John 12:49<br/>Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. &#x2013; John 14:10<br/>I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. &#x2013; Jn 8:42<br/>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. &#x2013; John 7:28<br/>Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, &amp; that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. &#x2013; Jn 8:28<br/>I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. &#x2013; Jn 5:30<br/>Let us recap what we see here in these verses. (1.) If Jesus were the Father, then he would have spoken of/from himself, contrary to what he said (Jn 7:17, 12:49, 10:10). (2.) If Jesus were the Father, then he would have honored himself, but Jesus stated he did not himself, but the Father honored him (Jn 8:54). (3.) If Jesus were the Father, then the Father&#x2019;s will would he his own will, but Jesus repeatedly stated he came not to do his own will (Jn 5:30). (4.) If Jesus were the Father, then what Jesus did was of himself, but Jesus stated he did nothing of himself (Jn 8:28). (5.) If Jesus were the Father, then he would have sent himself &amp; come of himself, but Jesus stated he did not send himself, nor came of himself (Jn 7:28, 8:42). All of these points prove that Jesus cannot be the heavenly Father. Notice also Jn 8:28 above where Jesus states so clearly &#x201c;my Father hath taught me&#x201d;. Jesus makes a very clear distinction that his heavenly Father is a distinct person from himself. You would have to be deceived not to see this.<br/>M.               The Witness of Men and the Spirit World<br/><br/>Though we do not accept or stand on the testimony of men or of devils, yet the scripture gives us their testimony. What is amazing is that Jesus as the Truth when he heard the testimony of men and of devils concerning himself did not correct them. The record we have concerning men who believed on Jesus shows that the one common thing they always came to the revelation of was not Jesus only but that Jesus was the Son of God. Thus, the Biblical record we have shows that people who truly come to know Jesus know first and foremost that is the second person of the Godhead.<br/>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Acts 8:37<br/>Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. Mt 27:54/Mk 15:39<br/>Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. Mt 14:33<br/>Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; John 1:49<br/>And I [John the Baptist] saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God. John 1:34<br/>Even angels declared this same important truth:<br/>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: &#x2026; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. Luke 1:32,35<br/>Every case where someone spoke falsehood to Jesus, Jesus as the Truth always brought correction because he stood on the truth. Why is it then that when the devil tempts Jesus at the end of the 40 days Satan starts off each of his temptations with &#x201c;If thou be the Son of God&#x201d; (Mt 4:3,6, Lk 4:3,9)? If Jesus were not the Son of God, then this would not be a basis for temptation. If Jesus were in truth the Son of God, then each solicitation of the devil was rooted in Jesus&#x2019; very identity and trying to get Jesus to misuse the fact of who he was.<br/>Now we have to ask ourselves some very important questions. Does Satan know who Jesus is? Was Satan before his fall in the very presence of God and did not he, as Lucifer, once worship the Lord? Yes. All the angels of God worshipped the Father and the Son (Isa 6:1-3,5,8, Heb 1:6, Rev 7:10-11) and they all knew who God was and who Jesus was. So the devil and his underlings know who Jesus is. Yet when Satan comes to tempt Jesus the greatest temptation he could have used would have been &#x201c;If thou be God&#x201d;. Yet, not once does Satan say this. His temptations are always from the basis of Jesus being the Son of God. Sadly, the devil knows who Jesus is more than those who have believed the false doctrine of Jesus only.<br/>We see the same statement coming from the devils when they encountered Jesus. They always without exception called attention to the fact that Jesus was the Son of God and never that he was God.<br/>behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? Mt 8:29<br/>And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. Mark 3:11<br/>And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. Mark 5:7 (Lk 8:28)<br/>And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ. Luke 4:41<br/>Let us take a moment to understand what is meant by the term &#x2018;Christ&#x2019;. For in the previous verse (LK 4:41) it says the devils &#x201c;knew he was Christ&#x201d;. Sadly here again Jesus only people will try to distort the scriptures and say that the devils knew Jesus was Christ and that Jesus as &#x2018;Christ&#x2019; was saying that he was God the Father. But this again is a twisting of the scripture, for &#x2018;Christ&#x2019; just means the anointed one or Messiah. Even this shows that he was anointed of another, not himself. In fact, the scripture itself defines exactly what this anointing as Christ was: it was his Sonship! To be Christ (i.e. the anointed one) was to be the Son of God. Listen to the Word:<br/>And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. &#x2013; John 6:69<br/>Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. &#x2013; Mt 16:16<br/>She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. &#x2013; John 11:27<br/>

		<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 200px;  padding: 10px;">

		</div>


		I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. &#x2013; Mt 26:63<br/>Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? And Jesus said, I am: &#x2013; Mk 14:61-62<br/>And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. &#x2013; Acts 9:20<br/>Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. &#x2013; 1Jn 2:22<br/>What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? Mt 22:42<br/>N.                What then is the Jesus only doctrine?<br/><br/>This section is introduced so that you may see what the standard belief of only doctrine is. We will see the doctrine of Jesus only is not an apostolic doctrine at all but was started by false teachers after the apostolic age ended.<br/>The belief that God exists in three &quot;manifestations&quot; is called Sabellianism or modalism:<br/>Sabellianism or Modalism. Sabellius (A.D. 200), the originator of this viewpoint, spoke of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but he understood all three as no more than three manifestations of one God. This teaching came to be known as modalism because it views one God who variously manifests Himself in three modes of existence: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<br/>In a Los Angeles radio show, ''Living By the Word'', KKLA-FM broadcast host Jim Coleman's interviewed Jakes on August 23 and 30, 1998 and asked Jakes how important it is for Christians to believe in the Trinity. Jakes responds:<br/>I think it's very, very significant that we first of all study the Trinity apart from salva&#x00ad;tion, and first of all that we embrace Christ and come to him to know who he is. Having come to know who he is, then we begin to deal with the Trinity, which I believe is a very complex issue. The Trinity, the term 'Trinity,' is not a biblical term, to begin with.<br/>It's a theological description for something that is so beyond human comprehension that I'm not sure that we can totally hold God to a numerical system. The Lord said, ''Behold, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one, and beside him there is no other.'' When God got ready to make a man that looked like him, he didn't make three. He made one man. However, that one man had three parts. He was body, soul, and spirit. We have one God, but he is Father in creation, Son in redemption, and Holy Spirit in regeneration.<br/>Thus, any personal relationship between these &quot;modes&quot; of God is not real, but only apparent. The only problem with this is it is a lie. For we see:<br/>The Holy Spirit in creation: The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. Job 33:4<br/>The Holy Spirit in redemption: Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. John 3:5<br/>The Father in redemption: thou, O LORD, art our father, our redeemer &#x2013; Isa 63:16; He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. Psalm 89:26<br/>Jesus only people therefore say that &#x201c;the Son&#x201d; was only manifested while Jesus was here on earth and that having come, died, been buried, resurrected, and ascended into heaven the &#x201c;Son&#x201d; is no more, since this is just a mode that God showed himself to us. Friend, IF this were truth then the apostles in the scriptures after Jesus&#x2019; ascension would bear witness to this and not speak of the Son any longer. But we find such is not the case. Let us follow the true apostolic pattern laid down by the apostles in their doctrine and not some twisting of the scriptures of some men&#x2019;s private interpretations.<br/>And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Gal 4:6<br/>Notice in this verse how it is not the Spirit of God but the Spirit of his Son and that that spirit cries in us not Jesus, Jesus only, but rather Abba, Father. Hence, we see the distinction of the Godhead of three separate persons Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is maintained in true apostolic doctrine even after the ascension. In all truth then anyone caught up in the deception of Jesus onlyer does not know their father.<br/>O.                By their Fruits you will Know them<br/><br/>Once we misunderstand the very nature of God and twist the scriptures to bring God down to our level by eliminating the concept of the trinity which is clearly taught in the scripture, then we have a god of our own making. The first signs of worshipping a false god are two fold: unsound doctrine and ungodly character. Both of these fruits are seen in abundance among those who are convinced of the Jesus only doctrine. Many strange and diverse doctrine which fly in the very face of what our Lord Jesus taught spring up amongst them. This is why Jesus only people have the following strange and diverse doctrines which do not set people free but rather put them into the very bondage of religion which Jesus came to set us free from.<br/>The very spirit which Jesus despised was that found in the Pharisees and scribes and doctors of the law who were ready to prove their points, condemn the innocent, laden on the burden of the law, but who where not able to hear the word of God or to acknowledge truth. Jesus only doctrine always seem to encompass the following:<br/>&#x25e6;       ritualistic baptism with a mere formula mentality that it is to be in Jesus&#x2019; name only when the Bible clearly shows it was not in Jesus&#x2019; name many times<br/>&#x25e6;       a system of dead works which includes:<br/>&#x25e6;       salvation by works which includes water baptism, speaking in tongues, church membership, &amp; external holiness practices of modifying dress &amp; hair<br/>&#x25e6;       sanctification by the law resulting in external holiness by the law of com&#x00ad;mand&#x00ad;ments rather than by internal holiness by the Spirit<br/>&#x25e6;       a self-deceived concept of self-perfection in this life<br/>&#x25e6;       men&#x2019;s traditions &amp; commandments resulting in man-made regulations of dress, hair coverings, where one can go &amp; not go, prohibitions of cosmetics &amp; jewelry &#x2013; all of which put women in bondage, but do nothing to develop true character<br/>&#x25e6;       being concerned more with controlling people&#x2019;s personal lives than developing their spiritual lives and developing mercy and compassion for the poor<br/>&#x25e6;       confusing the spiritual with the natural<br/>The common teaching amongst Jesus onlyers is that salvation requires all of the following: faith, repentance, water baptism in the name of Jesus only, and the evidence of speaking in tongues. But the Bible says that salvation came to us the moment we believed the gospel, not AFTER all these things.<br/>That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Eph 1:12-13<br/>[Note: the word &#x2018;after&#x2019; bolded above is clearly understood to be immediately after, but if anyone is contentious about this understand that the Greek demands it be immediately afterward, for the word &#x2018;after&#x2019; here is actually not in the Greek, but is a result of trying to accurately communicate the verb tense in English. The verb tense is actually as follows: &#x201c;ye having heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also ye having believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise&#x201d;. The immediacy is very clear from the Greek.]<br/>All of these things rather than showing the depth of their spirituality actually shows the true and utter poverty of their spirituality in that they focus on the natural and completely miss the true spiritual. They have left their first love Jesus and have returned to the law which produces bondage and death rather than liberty and life. This is why when in conversations with them there is never any true fellowship in the things of God. They cannot bring the life of the Spirit because it is not in them.<br/>Talking with them, per my experience, and the experience of many others is the same as talking with any other cult. They are argumentative, proud and haughty. They are high-minded and exclusivists. They always claim they are the only true church and there is no salvation outside them. Their pet doctrines are what they always talk about. They proof-text their arguments and twist the scriptures to say what they want to say but they will not listen to anything that contradicts what they believe. It has never been the case where I have been able to reason together according to the scriptures and cover the word of God line upon line, precept upon precept them. Why are Jesus only people so divisive? Because they have not come to the knowledge of the Son of God!<br/>Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning &#x2013; Eph 4:13-14<br/>P.                  True Salvation is Dependent upon whom You Believe in<br/>

			Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. – John 4:22-24

		<br/>Ultimately, Jesus onlyers, according to the Word of God, are liars on two counts: (1) for they deny that Jesus is the Christ (i.e. the anointed one), for no one can anoint themselves, yet they claim Jesus sent and anointed himself for he is the Father and the Son. Yet the truth is, if one is anointed they must be anointed of another. (2) Jesus onlyers are liars by the Word of God because they have not believed the record which God the Father gave of his Son, for they say life is in Jesus only, but the Bible says clearly this life is in His Son.<br/>Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. 1 John 2:22-24<br/>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 1 John 5:10-11<br/>True salvation requires that we believe in the Son of God, not just a temporary existence of Jesus or a mode or manifestation of God, but in the eternal Son who came from the Father and is the only begotten of the Father. In fact, the gospel of John and the epistle of 1John were specifically written so that we might believe in the Son of God.<br/>But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name. John 20:31 [NOTE: we must believe not Jesus only or Jesus is the Father or Jesus is the Holy Spirit, but that Jesus is the Son of God.!]<br/>These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. 1Jn 5:13<br/>This is so important that our very salvation is dependent upon it as the following verses will show. Sadly Jesus onlyer&#x2019;s who think they have the corner on true salvation and that they only are saved, are in fact the very ones that have denied the salvation that the Bible and Jesus offers. Whosever believes in God &#x2018;s only begotten Son has the promise of everlasting life. If the Jesus onlyer will not believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God, they will perish.<br/>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18<br/>Notice how clear these next verses are: if we believe on the Son (Note: not &#x201c;Jesus only&#x201d;, but &#x201c;on the Son&#x201d;) we will have everlasting life, but if we will not believe on the Son, the wrath of God abides on us.<br/>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. John 3:35-36<br/>And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. John 6:40<br/>Notice how every recorded salvation shows them believing on the Son of God, not on the Father, not on the Holy Ghost, and not particularly on Jesus, but that Jesus was the Son of his heavenly Father. <br/>And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. John 6:69<br/>She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. John 11:27<br/>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Acts 8:37<br/>And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. 1 John 3:23<br/>Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 1Jn 5:5<br/>Even Jesus himself wanted to know if people believed that he was the Son of God. In fact, Jesus never once required people to believe that he was the Father or the Holy Ghost.<br/>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? John 9:35<br/>Jesus never claimed to be the Father or the Spirit, but always referred to the other persons of the godhead as individuals separate from him. Jesus&#x2019; claim was NEVER Jesus only. Jesus continually reinforced the idea of the trinity of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Hence, Jesus&#x2019; primary claim about himself was that he was the Son of God, the Christ anointed and sent of the Father, empowered by the Holy Ghost.<br/>Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified [to make holy, to consecrate], and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? John 10:36<br/>Jesus&#x2019; own words are so applicable to the Jesus only movement. Please, if you believe in Jesus only and not the trinity, hear Jesus&#x2019; own words:<br/>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. &#x2013; John 4:22-24<br/>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. &#x2013; John 7:28<br/>May you be enlightened and set free if you have believed the false doctrine of Jesus only. May you be protected from being corrupted by the doctrines of men from your most holy faith if not. Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. (2 John 1:3)<br/>(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. 1Jn 1:2-4<br/>May you have true fellowship with the Father AND with his Son Jesus Christ.<br/>Note: some try to twist 2Co 13:1 &#x201c;This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.&#x201d; This is not saying that the witness may be established by coming two or three times, for then we could establish anything by just saying it over &amp; over. That establishes nothing. Rather, Paul had come on both his first and second journeys with others who also witnessed to what he was saying and so it would be on this third trip also.<br/>Some Jesus onlyers have said that Jesus as the Son of God was only during his time here on earth, but this is clearly contrary to what the scripture says. Note also: &#x201c;Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.&#x201d; (Heb 4:13) Jesus said concerning those who overcome, &#x201c;I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.&#x201d; (Rev 3:5)
