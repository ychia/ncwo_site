		To the beloved Saints: Praise the Lord and God Bless You on this day. Have you ever given thought to the fact that the word &quot;ship&quot; or &quot;ships&quot; is actually recorded some 73 times in the New Testament scriptures? It is amazing when you think about it, but true. <br/><br/>Lets think about it for a moment. A ship: why mentioned so many times? A ship is a vehicle, built with the hands of man, for the purpose of moving man from one destination to another. It goes not on the ground, nor the air, but in the seas of water. On many occasions, Jesus himself used a ship to<br/>teach the disciples &quot;spiritual principles&quot;. Even though there are many examples, I would like to focus on this ONE EXAMPLE. &quot;And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, LET US PASS OVER UNTO THE OTHER SIDE. And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat INTO the ship, so that it was now full. And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a GREAT CALM. And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have no faith? And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? And they came over unto the other side of the sea---Mark 4:35--5:1<br/><br/>What a blessed example we have here of the presence of the Lord in the lives of those that believe. In this example we see just how much we can say we love Jesus, yet doubt the very essence of his being!! First, Jesus said in 4:35--Let us go to the other side, and this finishes in 5:1 with &quot;AND THEY CAME TO THE OTHER SIDE&quot;!!!!! The Word was spoken, the Word was fulfilled. Yet in between the Word being spoken and the Word being fulfilled was a great test, trial and storm. Should we not be able to learn this today? Hath not God said? Yes HE has, and no matter what test, trial or storm in life you are facing, you MUST remember that YOU WILL get to the other side. <br/><br/>This ship, represents our soul man. An unstable soul will vacillate back and forth, producing doubt and unbelief. This ship was tossed to and fro, waves, winds and water stormed against it, yet the whole time, it was Jesus who was asleep on a pillow. How sweet. He had not a care, not a worry, not a fear, for HE was the WORD!! And the Word can never fail. The frailty of the human soul was troubled. They were fearful, crying out, Master, Master, wake up. Do you not care that we perish? They were only thinking about themselves. They should have realized that if they were going to die, then so was he, and if he had no worry, then why did they. How many times have we cried, Master, Master, where are you? Do you not<br/>care that I am in trouble? The storm and seas represent humanity. The elements of life. The troubles, struggles, fears and doubts. Yet in the midst of all this, there IS stability. The Word of God. As the waves beat INTO the ship, so do the storms of life beat INTO our souls. <br/><br/>The ship was now FULL--vs.37, just like our soul gets overwhelmed with the pressures and gets full. Jesus slept peacefully on a pillow. Should not we be able to sleep peacefully on a pillow? If Jesus said you are going to the other side, then know that you are going to the other side. When Jesus rebuked the situation, they no longer were in fear of the circumstances, but were now awed at who was this man? <br/>

		Should not we be awed and be able to marvel in our own lives and say, Who is this man? The tests, trials and storms of life will determine just which foundation your house is built on. Is it sand? Or have you digged deep and laid the foundation on the rock? Will your house still be standing AFTER the winds, rains and storms come?--Mt.7:24-25.<br/><br/>We are called to flourish like &quot;PALM TREES&quot; in Psalm 92:12-15. Why? Because a Palm tree grows in the tropics where Hurricanes and strong storms blow. The Palm tree, is the only tree whose ROOTS, grow down, down, down and wrap around rocks under the ground. When the winds blow and the rains come and the storms pass, the Palm tree may bend, but it does not break and when the storm passes, in a few days the tree is upright again. Oh, hallelujah!! If your tree is rooted deep and grows deeper, and you are<br/>wrapped around the rock (Jesus), then you will remain standing when them floods roll in. This is another shadow and type of your soul. One last thing about Palm trees. What two things do they produce? Milk and Oil! My oh my!! Milk, as the milk of the Word and oil, the type of Holy<br/>Spirit. <br/><br/>Back to the ship! It says in Hebrews 6:18-19, that the hope set before us is that our SOUL IS TO BE ANCHORED!!!! Sure and steadfast. What does an anchor do? It stabilizes a ship during a time of storms.<br/>It stabilizes a ship during times of calm. It keeps a ship on course so that it does not go astray when the storms come. Sometimes, a ship is slowed down by the anchor dragging. Just like us at times. We need to<br/>be stabilized and slowed down so that we do not wander off course. Let your soul be anchored in the Word of God. In James 1:6-8, it says that a man that wavers, is like a WAVE of the SEA driven with the wind and tossed. That man is unstable and will receive nothing from the Lord. Where is your ship (soul) headed? On course into the eternal Kingdom? Are you going to the other side, peacefully? Are we moved by what men say, or the doctrines of men? Are we moved by doubt and unbelief that so many speak today? Or are you anchored?<br/><br/>It says in Jude 10-13 about a kind of carnal, natural people who speak EVIL of the things they know not about. They become &quot;spots&quot; in the midst of your feasts of charity. The word &quot;spots&quot; in verse 12, is SPILAS in the greek. This word means a ledge, reef or rocks under the sea. This means, that people of doubt, unbelief, natural, carnal in their thinking, will be like a ledge or reef in your midst. What does a ledge or reef do? They sink ships!!! Do not let the thinking of men, the doctrines of men or your own soul, sink your ship. Hold fast, anchored, steady, peaceful in knowing that you will get to the other side. And guess what? When you get there, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus will be with you!!<br/><br/>Do not let those in your presence that could cause you to fall in faith. Stay around those that will strengthen you and build you up. Why do you think that Paul turned Hymenaeus and Alexander over to satan that they learn not to blaspheme? Check it out. It was because they &quot;SHIPWRECKED&quot; the faith of others, by not being anchored in sound doctrine!! I Tim.1:18-20 Is your ship stable? In the storms of your soul and life right now, are you anchored? Is Jesus sleeping peacefully on the pillow of your soul? Or are you allowing the winds and waves to beat INTO your soul and make it full of worry, stress, strife, doubt and unbelief? Are you around those that would &quot;shipwreck&quot; your faith, or do you stand with the Palm Trees of righteousness? Remember Peter? He was in that ship! He cried out, Master, Master, do you not care that we perish? Oh, how he learned. Just like you and I are learning. If you will read Acts 12, you will see that after James was beheaded and killed with the sword by Herod, Peter was taken prisoner, chained between soldiers, was going to PERISH, PERISH, PERISH, PERISH, in the morning, yet it says in verse 6 that he WAS SLEEPING!!!!!!!! Oh hallelujah. Do you see it? He was sleeping. Just like that day his master slept peacefully in the ship. He no longer saw the storms of life, the fears, the worries, for he had become just like his master. Oh that we could be like him. <br/><br/>I pray you will sleep in peace. I pray your soul is anchored, your ship on course to the other side, and there is no reefs in your midst. God bless you all and have a wonderful thought on this. A Palm tree can only grow UP, by growing DOWN!! HE must increase, and we must decrease. May the wisdom of God build your ship, like it built Noah&#x2019;s! Your servant, Kim
