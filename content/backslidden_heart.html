		<p>Beloved and God fearing, faithful 
Saints: Praise the Lord and God 
bless you all this day. I greet you 
Elders, wives, families in all 
nations, and I greet all saints here 
this day, in the precious name of 
our Lord Jesus Christ. I pray this 
teaching today, this Holy Word, 
would bless YOU ALL, and cause 
us all in this hour of such 
deception and demonic seductions 
to be thankful for knowing truth 
and embracing such protection.</p>

		<p>I pray to God saints, we remember the words 
of the Apostles of Jesus Christ, and of Paul 
who shared we are to work OUT our salvation, 
OUR spiritual lives in this earth, WITH FEAR 
AND TREMBLING. Do you fear God? Do 
you TREMBLE at HIS holiness and what is 
coming? I pray we all do. I pray this teaching 
BLESSES you and causes YOUR heart to rend 
WIDE OPEN for HIS loving voice to be heard 
and lived.  I pray to God, that we would ALL 
allow the Holy Ghost to search our hearts and 
measure us BY the Word of God and bring 
conviction, which only the Holy Ghost can 
do IF our hearts are pure and we truly Fear the 
living God. The Word of God TODAY, prepares 
us for THAT day coming soon, when we ALL 
stand before the Lord in HIS GLORY. We are 
called to be BORN AGAIN, spiritually reborn 
saints, NOT in word, or confession, but in 
DEED of heart and character of life. May our 
hearts this day, be measured by HIS will and 
HIS voice. Jesus said, the Holy Ghost was 
OUR comforter saints, and HE was also the 
Spirit OF TRUTH. When HE, the Holy Ghost 
was come</p>

<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 200px; float: right; padding: 10px;">
John 16:8-9 </br>
And when he is come, he will 
reprove the world of sin, and of 
righteousness, and of judgment: 
[9] Of sin, because they believe 
not on me;
</div>

<p>WHEN HE is come, HE, the Comforter 
for US, will reprove (convict, admonish, 
expose a fault) to the world for sin, then 
righteousness THEN JUDGMENT. OF sin, 
Jesus said, because they BELIEVE not ON 
ME. Jesus did NOT say, believe IN ME, but 
believe ON ME. Did you see that? Many 
today believe IN Jesus, but few believe ON 
HIM! This word believe does not mean 
mental ascent or mental thought, but rather 
TO HAVE FAITH IN, TO ENTRUST, 
PUT TRUST IN. Jesus was saying, the Holy 
Ghost would convict those of sin, who do 
NOT TRUST in HIM, PUT THEIR LIFE 
into his Words and truth, do NOT hear HIS 
voice. With that said, I pray this teaching 
today truly enters ALL our hearts saints and 
we allow the Holy Ghost, OUR comforter 
to SEARCH OUR hearts to truly show us 
where we are in relationship to scripture, 
truth, JUDGMENT to come.</p>

<p>
God SENT the Holy Ghost as a PROMISE, 
that once HIS son, Jesus, died for our sins, 
HE, the Holy Ghost would come to live IN 
US, to make our bodies the TEMPLE of the 
living God!! The Holy Ghost would lead us, 
guide us, teach us ALL truth and keep us 
from falling FROM God, but rather more 
INTO HIM. HE would cleanse us daily 
washing us with the Word and when we sin 
or fall short, we repent, and continue on the 
path of righteousness which one day will 
take you the Judgment Seat, THEN 
prayerfully the Holy City. Yet the dangers 
today, are that MANY are preaching a Word 
behind pulpits with NO conviction, NO 
repentance, NO fear of God and NO 
judgment. People who call themselves 
Christians are living THEIR OWN lives, 
scattered in all ways, yet walking and 
mingling with the world. Then when HOLY 
men of God come, expose darkness, 
proclaim holiness and obedience and 
DYING TO SELF and brokenness, the 
carnally minded, earthly minded, turn a deaf 
ear.  When a heart begins to say NO GOD, 
then we become FOOLS and backsliding 
NOW slowly subtly, comes in to snare the 
once God fearing soul. Saints, NEVER say, 
NO GOD!!</p>

<img style="float: right" src="img/ark1.png"/>

<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 200px; float: left; padding: 10px;">
Psalm 53:1 </br>
The fool hath said in his heart, No 
God (my emphasis). Corrupt are 
they, and have done abominable 
iniquity: there is none that doeth 
good.
</div>

<p>The fool has said in his heart, NO GOD!! In 
other words, when God speaks, when God comes 
with Messengers, the HOLY Word is spoken, yet 
to the backslidden, there is NO fear, NO desire 
to turn at his reproof, for the fool says, NO 
GOD!! I will choose my way, but I know you 
love me God, so all will be okay. Not so saints. 
One sure way, ONE sure way of knowing IF your 
heart is backslidden in your relationship to the 
Word of God, prayer and House of God, is that 
WHEN HIS reproof comes from the Word or 
Holy men of God, do you say, YES GOD, help 
me, or NO GOD, I will not hear that. Do you 
hunger daily, for HIS Word, do you arise with 
prayer and Word time daily getting close to Jesus, 
SEEKING HIS ways and love? If not, the heart is 
falling</p>


<p>I write today with heaviness in my heart and 
spirit man. I write with a longing for the 
confessing saints in this day and hour, to be 
TRUE God fearing people. NOT according 
to OUR standards, but HIS!!  Not walking 
IN the world, WITH the world or being 
around those IN the world by friendship or 
relationship. I pray this day saints, ALL 
OUR hearts feel the conviction daily of 
holiness, righteousness and our calling to be 
LIKE JESUS as we all lay before the King of 
Kings and Lamb of God in all humility. I 
would like to share today, a teaching I have 
been working on several days now, yet now 
feel ready to share to you here at New 
Covenant, and to the nations, Elders, their 
wives and families and brethren elsewhere. I 
pray you ponder for a moment, yes, SELAH 
for a moment saints, and let the Holy Spirit 
touch your soul this day, by thinking of this:</p>

			<strong>The Sorrow and Shame of the Backslidden Heart</strong>
		</div>



<p>God SO loved the world, that while we were 
YET sinners, Christ DIED for us saints! 
Jesus was brutally chastened of sinful 
mocking men, brutally beaten, scourged, 
whipped, brutally nailed and spat upon for 
OUR shame and OUR sins and OUR 
impure hearts. Selah. Jesus was brutally 
wounded saints, for OUR sins.</p>

<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 200px; float: right; padding: 10px;">
Romans 5:8 </br>
But God commendeth his love 
toward us, in that, while we were 
yet sinners, Christ died for us.
</div>

<p>Yet in our failures, sins, deprived minds of 
lust, lasciviousness and worldliness, being 
under the prince of the power of the air--
Eph.2 and children of disobedience in the 
lusts thereof, God SO COMMENDED HIS 
LOVE toward us, in that WHILE WE 
WERE YET sinners, Christ died for our 
sins. Look what they DID TO our Lord 
Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, whose blood 
was WITHOUT SPOT and blemish. 
Prophecy fulﬁlled:</p>

<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 800px; float: none; margin: 20px auto; padding: 10px 10px 10px 40px">
			Isaiah 50:6 <br/>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.<br/><br/>Matthew 26:67 <br/>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him (to beat with the fists!!) ; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,<br/><br/>Matthew 27:30 <br/> And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. (meaning they WHIPPED his face and head with a stinging reed)<br/><br/>Mark 10:34 <br/>And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.<br/><br/>Mark 14:65 <br/>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
		</div>

<p>Such shame!! Such HUMILIATION!!
Such depravity did they scourge OUR Lord 
Jesus Christ. They pulled his hair out, 
scourged his back, spat on him, beat him, 
whipped him. And they were not done, for 
then they DROVE NAILS into his hands, 
and his feet!! Why saints? FOR OUR 
SINFUL HEARTS, THAT is why. Jesus 
endured ALL this for OUR sins, for OUR 
SHAME!! Remember that word saints, 
SHAME, for this teaching today, is about 
such. Selah and Selah again this day. Yet 
EVERY BEATEN FIST to his face 
disﬁgured him, EVERY reeds punishing 
sting to whip his face, every thorn in his 
head, every piece of TORN ﬂesh from his 
back, EVERY DISGUSTING spit upon his 
face and body, JESUS DID This with joy in 
his heart for US, you and I, knowing his pain, 
suﬀering and SHAME, would endure for a 
time, THEN salvation would come and for 
us to be saved by his BLOOD!! With that 
said, now let us proceed!</p>


<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 200px; float: right; padding: 10px;">
Hebrews 12:2 </br>
Looking unto Jesus the author 
and finisher of our faith; who 
for the joy that was set before 
him endured the cross, 
despising the shame, and is set 
down at the right hand of the 
throne of God.
</div>


<p>Jesus, who for the JOY SET BEFORE HIM, 
which was OUR salvation and OUR SINS 
being purged saints, HE ENDURED the 
Cross, despising the SHAME. Jesus TOOK 
OUR sins, our lusts, our ﬂeshly nature, our 
evil and he HUNG IT ON THE CROSS as 
his body shed blood to cover all. Jesus took 
adultery, fornication, lasciviousness, hatred, 
anger, concupiscence, uncleanness, wrath, 
drunkenness, reveling, and he NAILED it to 
the Cross, as he himself despised the 
SHAME. In other words saints, Jesus took 
OUR SHAME, OUR SINS, OUR 
weaknesses and HE shed his blood so our 
Father could FORGIVE US!! This is why 
when we be BORN AGAIN, we start life 
over, yearning for, hungering for, truth in life. 
IF we sin, we get up, repent and stay on 
course. WE NEVER change course saints. 
What happens to those now who once 
KNEW such truth, lived such a life in purity, 
holiness and Godly witness to others, what 
happens now to a heart that falls back? 
When the Word of God no longer causes you 
to weep or fear, THEN you know, your heart 
is falling away and not pressing more INTO 
Christ. The Bible says, Jesus took OUR 
SHAME, but a backslidden heart, puts 
SHAME back on Jesus, and THAT saints, I 
can not fathom nor understand how ANY 
could say they love Jesus, yet fall away. May 
we see this day, how many will put SHAME 
back on Jesus. In other words, they take what 
HE gave, and they give it back.
THE  SORROW AND THE SHAME OF THE BACKSLIDDEN HEART -- SELAH
Hebrews 12:2 
Looking unto Jesus the author 
and finisher of our faith; who 
for the joy that was set before 
him endured the cross, 
despising the shame, and is set 
down at the right hand of the 
throne of God</p>

<p>May this writing this day, bring such a 
conviction to all hearts, in that we continue 
to SEARCH our hearts to see IF we truly be 
IN the real faith. Faith ONLY COMES by 
hearing and hearing BY the Word of God. If 
there be NO hunger, NO desire to hear or 
read the Word, then the ﬁre is diminishing 
within and be not deceived. IF we have NO 
desire saints to HEAR Holy men of God, 
preach, teach, take oversight and speak as 
vessels of God, then our hearts are falling 
away. When we live in a day and hour when 
FEW truly FEAR God, TRULY live for 
Jesus, TRULY crucify their ﬂesh every day, 
we see apostasy all around us. Yet we live in 
an hour when SO MANY profess to believe, 
SO MANY say they are Christians, yet Jesus 
said, they would come in the last days and 
DECEIVE many. Saints, I NEVER want my 
life, my witnessing or my doings to 
FALSELY deceive others. I desire my LIFE 
to live as Jesus lived and walked, that I may 
be CALLED OUT and be DIFFERENT 
than the many. I long that MY life, gives 
testimony to holiness and the fear of the 
living God! I pray we live lives of Godly 
sorrow, forever living truth, repentance of 
heart, seeking, pressing, to be more like Jesus 
every day. I pray you read this with open 
heart saints, and as you read, let the 
Holy Spirit SHOW YOU, the reﬂection 
of your OWN heart, if you were to 
look into a Spiritual mirror this day. 
Would you SEE Jesus in that reﬂection? 
IS YOUR BODY, SOUL and SPIRIT, 
reﬂecting JESUS?</p>


<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 200px; float: right; padding: 10px;">
Hebrews 12:28  </br>
Wherefore we receiving a 
kingdom which cannot be 
moved, let us have grace, 
whereby we may serve God 
acceptably with reverence and 
godly fear:
</div>



<p>The Sorrow and Shame of a 
backslidden heart brings a weeping to 
our Father in heaven, a sorrow to Jesus 
Christ, our Mediator and and a mocking 
shame to the Holy Spirit.
 It shames the very blood by which Jesus 
shed for our sins. A backslidden heart brings 
despite (insult) to the HOLY Spirit in our 
lives--Heb. 10 for ALL Jesus did. When we 
allow the backslidden heart IN, our life 
NOW puts the SHAME BACK ON 
JESUS!!!!!! This will be unforgivable by God 
Almighty, less Godly Sorrow, repentance and 
a contrite heart come back. A backslidden 
heart comes from the deceitfulness of sin 
which hardens, then that heart departs from 
the LIVING God without Godly sorrow</p>


<p>Oh God have mercy on any that would PUT 
HIM, our Lord Jesus to OPEN SHAME. 
Hebrews Chapters 2-4 ought to put the fear of 
God into ALL of us, and here, the Holy Ghost 
says by the Apostle of God, that when one was 
ONCE enlightened, ONCE tasted of God's 
mercy, grace, callings, they TASTED of the 
GOOD Word of God, yet IF THEY FALL 
AWAY, depart, walk away from truth, life, 
vows to God, and go back into the world, they 
crucify to THEMSELVES the Son of God 
afresh and PUT HIM, JESUS, to open Shame. 
May God have mercy on our souls. SO HOW 
DOES GOD save us from such damnation? HE 
sends HIS holy messengers, who warn, preach, 
chasten. God sends HIS beloved saints, to 
reprove, convict in meekness and love. If the 
heart is true, weepings of sorrow, GODLY 
Sorrow will come, unto repentance Paul said 
and unto salvation.</p>

<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 200px; float: right; padding: 10px;">
Hebrews 6:4-6 </br>
For it is impossible for those who 
were once enlightened, and have 
tasted of the heavenly gift, and were 
made partakers of the Holy Ghost, [5] 
And have tasted the good word of 
God, and the powers of the world to 
come, [6] If they shall fall away, to 
renew them again unto repentance; 
seeing they crucify to themselves the 
Son of God afresh, and put him to an 
open shame.
</div>


<p>To even think of Jesus, HIS HOLINESS, the 
King of Kings, sitting at the right hand of a 
Holy Father, still with pierced hands, feet and 
side, only to be shamed by those who profess 
to know him, I can not fathom the depth of his 
pain. Oh, Satan loves every lukewarm 
Christian, every professing believer with no 
fear, no repentance and no LONGING to be on 
bended knee worshipping in holiness. While 
many THINK they are "Christian", they are 
Christians by confession only, only by 
profession, but NOT by conviction of Godly 
fear. I have seen over my years in ministry, 
MANY fall away in Africa, in the Philippines, 
and sadly, even here. I have seen my own flesh 
and blood family, who all profess to be 
believers, walk in darkness spiritually, yet I 
continue to this day to warn them, preach to 
them, and share judgment day comes for all.
Today, the hour of great DECEPTION we live 
in, Jesus WARNED us, Paul WARNED us, 
Peter WARNED us, Jude WARNED us. I so 
respected my dear Brother David Wilkerson, 
for he WARNED people daily and I have lived 
my life best I can to preach with no 
compromise and WARN saints around the 
world, to live God fearing, repentant lives. 
OUR homes, OUR marriages, OUR children, 
OUR testimony, is to convict the world of SIN, 
righteousness AND judgment to come.  The 
backslidden heart is FILLED with selfwill, self 
wants, self desires and only listens to self and 
has no fear of God. The backslidden heart 
makes its OWN decisions, contrary to 
scripture, then thinks once done, it can say 
sorry God, and go on. NOT SO. The 
Backslidden heart has NO fear, and they make 
their OWN decisions AGAINST truth and the 
Word of God, planning their own damnation 
and deceit by walking out of God's purpose, yet 
they then expect God to HONOR self decisions 
and ACCEPT  their words of "sorry God", yet 
they never go back to where they fell. Jesus 
said,</p>

<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 800px; float: none; margin: 20px auto; text-align: center; padding: 20px;">
Rev. 2:4-5   </br>

    Nevertheless I have somewhat against 
thee, because thou hast left thy first love. 
[5] Remember therefore from whence thou 
art fallen, and repent, and do the first 
works; or else I will come unto thee 
quickly, and will remove thy candlestick 
out of his place, except thou repent
</div>

<p>NO one, no brother, no sister, no man of 
God can persuade their heart to repent, for 
they have fallen far from serving the one and 
true living God. The lure of the world, the 
ﬂesh slowly causes their heart and minds to 
become LUKEWARM, where they have just 
enough in them to cause others to THINK 
they are truly children of God, yet their lives, 
represent NO life in Christ. Paul said in 
Titus 1:16, MANY PROFESS to KNOW 
God, yet they deny (contradict) him and 
every GOOD THING they do, EVERY 
GOOD work they think is for God, is 
abominable and REPROBATE, but Titus, 
continue THOU in Sound Doctrine, 
TRUTH. Now, please think and meditate 
upon this. One can NOT be backslidden 
if they were NEVER saved. I say again, 
you can not be a backslider IF you never 
knew truth. The unrighteous and unsaved, 
they can not backslide, for they never knew 
the way, the truth or the life. But the Bible 
WARNS us saints, of those who ONCE 
knew the way, TASTED of the Holy things 
of the Spirit, ESCAPED the pollutions of 
the world through the knowledge of Jesus 
Christ, only to sin, walk away, become 
hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, then 
they fall back, from the hunger, thirst and 
beckoning cry of Holiness! In a backslidden 
heart, there are no tears, no fears, no knees 
to weep on. The backslidden heart refuses to 
turn at the reproof of God. When men of 
God speak, cry out, to save their souls, they 
turn a deaf ear, but ON THAT day, that deaf 
ear will SURELY hear Jesus speak.</p>

<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 200px; float: right; padding: 10px;">
2 Peter 2:18-22 </br>
    For when they speak great swelling 
words of vanity, they allure through 
the lusts of the flesh, through much 
wantonness, those that were clean 
escaped from them who live in error. 
[19] While they promise them liberty, 
they themselves are the servants of 
corruption: for of whom a man is 
overcome, of the same is he brought 
in bondage. [20] For if after they 
have escaped the pollutions of the 
world through the knowledge of the 
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they 
are again entangled therein, and 
overcome, the latter end is worse with 
them than the beginning. 
[21] For it had been better for them 
not to have known the way of 
righteousness, than, after they have 
known it, to turn from the holy 
commandment delivered unto them. 
[22] But it is happened unto them 
according to the true proverb, The 
dog is turned to his own vomit again; 
and the sow that was washed to her 
wallowing in the mire.
	</div>

<img style="float: left; max-width: 300px; margin: 10px;" src="img/tabernacle.png"/>

<p>A way to measure the TRUE Holy Spirit 
LED life is this. IF you are led of the Spirit, 
you will not live in sin, NOT continue to 
walk your path, NOT partake with the 
worldly or fellowship with the unsaved. As 
you mature, get Older in Christ, ARE you 
being led MORE of the Spirit? As you grow 
older in Christ, are you on your knees more 
as you mature? Do you despise sin more? 
Do you hate evil more? Do you detest the 
ﬂesh and carnality more? Do you crucify 
your ﬂesh MORE and carry your Cross daily? 
Do you hunger MORE to hear the Word 
of God? Do you desire to pray more? Is 
there a longing to be with other brethren 
always? Do you condemn the world? Do 
you weep for the lost and unsaved? Is your 
heart for the poor? Do you dedicate your life 
to GIVE all you have for the hungry, orphans 
and widows as the Bible says? Do you submit 
to authority and honor those set over you in 
the Lord? Do you FAST and seek after such 
holiness? Do you cry out to God for the 
Bishop ministry to protect your soul that you 
sin not? Do you SEEK out wise counsel and 
seek those over you in the Lord to measure 
your heart and life? Do you LISTEN to 
counsel and the voices of the righteous? Do 
you LONG to be IN the House of God? Do 
you LONG to seek the face of Jesus and the 
reﬂection of HIS LIGHT in YOUR 
countenance of heart? IF married, do YOU 
pray more, love more, grow MORE in 
Christ? THAT is a Holy Spirit led life saints 
that is forever growing from glory to glory 
into the IMAGE of the son of God.</p>

Hebrews 3:11-14  </br>
So I sware in my wrath, They 
shall not enter into my rest.) [12] 
Take heed, brethren, lest there be 
in any of you an evil heart of 
unbelief (rebellion, disobedience), 
in departing (walking away, 
leaving, turning) from the living 
God. [13] But exhort one another 
daily, while it is called To day; lest 
any of you be hardened through 
the deceitfulness of sin. [14] For 
we are made partakers of Christ, 
if we hold the beginning of our 
confidence stedfast unto the end;

<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 200px; float: right; padding: 10px;">
2 Cor. 3:17-18  </br>

    Now the Lord is that Spirit: and 
where the Spirit of the Lord is, there 
is liberty. [18] But we all, with open 
face beholding as in a glass (a 
mirror) the glory of the Lord, are 
changed into the same image from 
glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of 
the Lord.
	</div>
    
   <p>Saints, when the Holy Spirit matures YOU, 
you grow more and more INTO HIS glory and 
image. That mirror, that reflection, is the glory 
of God, the glory of Jesus Christ and you are 
CHANGED into the same image. Oh, saints, 
are we?  Are we doers of all we hear? Does that 
countenance and reflection on our hearts 
SHINE Jesus to others? What about the 
backslider? The backslider 
is COMFORTABLE, enjoying the natural 
world and life. The backslider has fallen 
AWAY from truth, AWAY from obedience, 
AWAY from holiness, AWAY from repentance, 
all the while saying, I love Jesus. They love 
pleasures MORE than they love God. The 
Bible does not say they do not think they love 
God, it says, they love pleasures, MORE than 
lovers of God. They have lost the edge, the fear 
of God, the commitment to holiness. A 
backslidden heart arises EACH new day saints, 
with no prayer, no desire to read the Bible, no 
desire to hear the Spirit speak. A backslidden 
heart goes out the worldly business daily, jobs, 
life, without having Jesus always on the mind. 
THAT is a fallen heart. They have a peace, but 
the peace the world gives and NOT the Peace 
Jesus gave. They have a FORM of Godliness, 
but DENY the power of the living truth. They 
fellowship, make covenant with, join 
in friendship with the unsaved, yet have no 
realization of what is coming.  The backslider 
does just that, they slide BACK, for their hand 
is off the plow. As Peter said,
But it is happened unto them according to 
the true proverb, The dog is turned to his 
own vomit again; and the sow that was 
washed to her wallowing in the mire. In 
other words, back to the OLD nature and 
SELF ways in life.
In the book of Proverbs, the book of 
WISDOM:</p>

<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 800px; float: none; margin: 20px auto; text-align: center; padding: 20px;">
Proverbs 14:14  </br>
The backslider in heart shall be filled 
with his own ways: and a good man 
shall be satisfied from himself.
</div>

<p>Did you see it? The backslider in heart is 
FILLED WITH HIS OWN ways, and a good 
man will be delivered FROM himself, FROM 
SELF saints. The righteous FEAR falling back, 
FEAR departing from the living God, FEAR 
choosing self and OWN ways, for the good 
man is satisfied FROM HIMSELF. Yet to the 
backslider, his walk with God is his own way, 
not the Spirit way. A backslidden heart is one 
with no subjection to change, hear admonition 
or turn at any reproof.</p>

<p>A backslider has no repentance when sin 
enters the life or heart and this brings sorrow 
and shame to the Lord who died for them. 
Satan has gripped the heart to deceive to 
think all is well, ALL IS WELL, when all is 
NOT well. They still walk forward 
thinking, all is clear, yet their path is parallel 
and NOT ON the path God ordained. When 
you think about backsliding saints, I am not 
saying they NO LONGER SAY THEY 
LOVE JESUS, I am sharing the Word of 
God. The backslider serves GOD, YES 
serves Jesus, THEIR OWN WAY, not God's 
way, for this cause, damnation awaits all who 
live such lives of deception. They live for 
God their OWN way.</p>

Proverbs 16:25  </br>
There is a way that seemeth right 
unto a man, but the end thereof are 
the ways of death.

<p>Jesus said, ONLY THEM WHO HEAR and 
DO the will of HIS Father, shall go to 
heaven. MANY on THAT day, will cry out, 
BUT LORD, LORD, I did this and I did 
that, and Jesus will say, DEPART FROM 
ME, I never knew you. We are to be rooted, 
grounded, planted, established in our faith, 
not moved, but built on a rock.  The word 
"backslider" means: ONE who falls back, 
one who goes back, one who retreats. What 
do they fall back to? What do they go back 
to? What do they retreat back to?  Their 
OWN ways saints, and soon, the old nature 
SUBLTY creeps in and the angel of light 
NOW snares them with his lure. Oh, over 
the years of such truth, I have seen so many 
who KNEW Kingdom, go back to birthdays, 
back to Christ-Mass, back to Easter, back to 
the ﬂesh. In other words, they fall BACK to 
the ﬂesh, the old ways, STILL saying they 
love Jesus, STILL saying they love God, and 
yet now they have no fear, no hunger, no 
desire to even hear the beckoning cries of 
God who sends HIS messengers to warn.
n II Chronicles 36, it says the wrath of God 
is reserved for those who MOCK the 
Messengers of God, who DESPISE his 
warnings of truth, who misuse HIS 
prophets! This was the fate of many and once 
you lose this edge, sadly, the shame it brings 
to Jesus Christ is overwhelming. Saints, we 
are called to NEVER LOOK BACK, for if 
we do, we are NOT ﬁt for HIS Kingdom--
Lu.9:57-61. </p>

Jude 1:17-25  </br>
But, beloved, remember ye the words which 
were spoken before of the apostles of our 
Lord Jesus Christ; [18] How that they told 
you there should be mockers in the last time, 
who should walk after their own ungodly 
lusts. [19] These be they who separate 
themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit. 
[20] But ye, beloved, building up yourselves 
on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy 
Ghost, [21] Keep yourselves in the love of 
God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus 
Christ unto eternal life. [22] And of some 
have compassion, making a difference: [23] 
And others save with fear, pulling them out 
of the fire; hating even the garment spotted 
by the flesh. </br>
[24] Now unto him that is able to keep you 
from falling, and to present you faultless 
before the presence of his glory with 
exceeding joy, [25] To the only wise God our 
Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and 
power, both now and ever. Amen.

<p>Many who see the backslider, think they are 
a good Christian person, yet they live NOT 
at the Tree of Life. And what is amazing, is 
the God fearing, the righteous, they SEE the 
backslidden heart, but those in such a state, 
are blind to it. THAT is why God says, 
HEAR THE VOICES of those set over you 
in the Lord, HEAR the voices of men of 
God who have NOT fallen away, HEAR 
THE VOICES of them who cry out to save 
them from the garments spotted by the 
ﬂesh. HEAR their counsel and follow their 
lead and the path of righteousness shall be 
set before you, the blood forgiving and 
NEW life will spring forth. IF, a backslider 
ever does repent, much work has to be done, 
even greater work must be done, than when 
they were ﬁrst saved. Yet, they SHALL be 
saved, Praise God. The testimony of the 
backslider no longer BURNS as words that 
enter the heart. The ones who will suﬀer 
most, are the unsaved family members and 
friends, co workers, bosses, that the 
righteous are to preach to, for the backslider 
will never witness nor warn the unrighteous 
of their ways, for when they die, they surely 
will now have had no witness to get them 
into Eternal Life. The backslider will suﬀer 
greater damnation then the unsaved.</p>

Rev. 16:15 </br>
 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is 
he that watcheth, and keepeth his 
garments, lest he walk naked, and 
they see his shame.
	</div>


<p>Notice how the God fearing, the righteous, 
the holy, THEY pray in the Holy 
Ghost, THEY have holy faith, THEY 
TRY to save such with FEAR, trying to 
PULL THEM OUT of the ﬁre, hating the 
garment (covering, clothing) that is spotted 
by the ﬂesh. Yet look what Jesus said. He said 
those that WATCH--be vigilant, keep eye, be 
alert-- and KEEPETH--to guard, protect, his 
garments--that one shall not be shamed.
The backslider is naked in God's eyes, 
UNCOVERED, UNPORTERED, 
UNPROTECTED. The sadness and sorrow 
this brings to my heart, is that I have seen 
this over and over and over again in my life. 
In the nations, around the world, in America, 
I have seen many who no longer fear God 
nor desire to be holy, pure, chaste, sanctiﬁed, 
washed with the regeneration of the Spirit 
IN the Word of God. We have men in Africa 
now to this day, that hold services each week, 
yet they are thieves, robbers, liars, 
Adulterers, fornicators with NO making 
right with God. They profess THEY 
KNOW God, yet are abominable to HIM. 
We live in an hour of GREAT apostasy the 
Bible says, perilous times, a time where 
SEDUCING SPIRITS and doctrines of 
devils (Christianity) will permeate the lives of 
many. A time when MANY will no longer 
listen to or follow SOUND Doctrine. IN 
America today, sin is now running rampant in 
the hearts of many professing believers. The 
so called Church is ﬁlled with Rock Music, 
Rock bands, have ﬁlled the HOLY Temple 
of God, Rock songs, rap songs, pornography, 
adultery, fornications, divorce, are all 
rampant, and are ALL without FEAR and 
trembling. The House of God is no longer a 
HOLY ground to many and the hunger for 
righteousness no longer ﬁlls the hearts. The 
backslidden heart never falls on the knees, or 
weeps to God to recover what Satan took.
Yet the one who falls, fails, misses God and 
then falls on their knees, weeps, cries, seeks 
Godly sorrow and repentance, salvation 
arises upon them. God's mercy and grace is 
forever upon them that call upon him out of 
a PURE, broken, holy heart. God has set a 
path before us ALL, a straight and narrow 
path, by which Jesus said FEW will ﬁnd and 
FEW will enter in. When we fall away, sin, go 
into the world, there is ONLY ONE way 
back, we must get back ON that path by the 
blood of Jesus.</p>

<p>Yet the Bible says the FOOL says in his 
heart, NO GOD! May we all live 
consecrated and holy lives saints. Fearing 
God and keeping HIS commandments. May 
we ALL fear, truly fear, EVER shaming Jesus 
Christ and may we never become SO 
hardened, we say NO GOD. Saints, The 
SORROW and SHAME of the 
BACKSLIDDEN Heart, ought to cause us 
to weep before God in prayer, seeking, crying 
out for mercy, that we NEVER turn our ear 
from HEARING HIS VOICE, which IS, 
the Holy Word. May we ENDURE TO THE 
END as Jesus said, HOLDING OUR 
conﬁdence to the end, for which, we SHALL 
be saved. Keep the faith, Brother Kim</p>
