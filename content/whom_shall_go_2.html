		&quot;Then said Jesus unto &quot;THE TWELVE&quot;, &quot;will you also go away&quot;? Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, TO WHOM SHALL WE GO? Thou hast the words of eternal life&quot;. John 6:67-68<br/><br/>Let us look again at these very profound words spoken. First notice that the question Jesus put to the twelve was, &quot;will you ALSO go away&quot;? This signifies that there was a certain group who had made a decision. It was a decision based on what they perceived THEY wanted instead of following what HE wanted. Jesus honored this decision, for HE will never violate ones free will to choose. All Jesus asked was, &quot;will you also make this decision&quot;? Will you twelve ALSO go away? For this fleeting moment, a decision had to be made. The others had made theirs. They chose to walk away. They chose to go where they wanted to go, not where HE desired them to go. It is amazing how many times Jesus made men search and look into their own hearts. Remember the woman caught in the act of Adultery? When charged, Jesus said to those with the stones, &quot;he amongst you without sin cast the first stone&quot;. One by one, for that fleeting moment, they had to once again look into their own hearts and lives. One by one they dropped the stones. Notice in John 8:9 that it began with the eldest dropping the stones first. Many times it is up to the eldest, those with older experience to be the ones to influence the younger. We must by example lead those around us. When decisions must be made, many times, it is the young ones who will follow the lead of those around them. It was Peter who spoke and said, &quot;TO WHOM SHALL WE<br/>GO&quot;?. It was as if his decision had great impact on those around him. Should not we also want to be examples to those around us? Should we not want to lead by example and hold fast to the WORD OF GOD? When things get tough, difficult and hard, it is up to those that are eldest to be the ones who pray more, read more, search more and keep stability<br/>to the young who can not support their own weight yet.<br/><br/>Will we deviate from the truth or hold fast to that which we have been taught? It was for the reason of the words of Jesus being &quot;HARD&quot; they said. Who can hear it? The twelve heard it!! The twelve heard it!! John 6:60-67<br/><br/>It is the apostate church in the last days that will not endure sound doctrine. Who can hear it, they will say. Who can stand to such a test, they will say. Who can hold to this and do it, they will say. Oh, you are being too strict and demanding, they will say. It is so simple for the soul man to justify his actions without responsibility. Remember what Peter said about the preachings and teachings of Paul? &quot;And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things &quot;HARD&quot; to be understood, which they that are UNLEARNED and UNSTABLE wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. Ye therefore, beloved, seeing you know<br/>these things before, BEWARE lest ye also, being led (seduced; take off together) away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness&quot;. II Peter 3:15-17<br/><br/>The point I would like to make here is this. It was not that the words of Paul were hard to understand. It was hard to them that were ignorant and unlearned to the Word of God. If you are unlearned and unstable to the Word of God, it will always be hard for you and can cause you to be led (seduced) away. It will be easy to follow christianity and the ways<br/>of men. Then when true Kingdom preachers come, they will be judged, condemned and spoken evil of, just like they did to Jesus and Paul. It is so easy to justify the soul and go back unto the easy way. No demands, no pressure, no conviction, no circumcision, no pain, easy to do gospel. This is the last day church. The apostate church. Full of easy believism. Full of easy entertainment. Full of pleasure and fun. Full of social living instead of holy living. Lovers of pleasures MORE<br/>than lovers of God. Friends, perilous times are upon us. People want the easy way out. They have an escape plan all worked out, in the name of grace, peace, love brother. Join in, be at ease, lighten up, join the crowd. Do not cause waves, blend, just be what you want to be. Do not be so serious or strict. Jesus is love. Preach unto us the smooth things, not the hard things. When the great number of disciples &quot;walked with HIM no more&quot;, a decision had to be made. Were they to follow after their friends? Were they to be persuaded by those around them? Were they to justify the actions of their friends by saying, Yes, we know Jesus can be hard at times? Were they to go with the masses? Were they to follow after mainstream theology? Or was there a total realization that at this point, they had nothing to go back to? Have all your<br/>bridges been burned behind you? Is your hand to a plow with no looking back? Are you fit for the Kingdom? Or is there an escape route in your soul, that if things get to tough, you have another to go to? To whom shall we go?<br/><br/>My brethren, when you embrace the Kingdom (not christianity) and the Kingdom embraces you, your life will never be the<br/>same. You will come into a life of persecution, tribulation, affliction. The lukewarm will condemn you. Judge you, when all you are doing is obeying the Word of God. They will call you hypocritical, dogmatic, pharisitic, legalistic. Yet all you are doing is following after a Holy and Just Lord. You will be called by God to expose the unfruitful works of darkness. You will at times see those you loved so much begin to go astray and yet you cannot follow them. Remember it was<br/>DISCIPLES, who walked with HIM no more. Yet the twelve made a decision. To whom shall we go? Not to where, or what other church or group. But to WHOM!!! If people would fall on their face before the Lord when they feel the Word is hard, then they would see what it is that HE would have them do. Jesus said in Mark 4 that there is a type of<br/>people who would only endure for a season. But when persecution and affliction arose because of the Word, they were offended. People will smile, sing and dance with you. But when demands are now put on them to change, to crucify the flesh and get their soul into the engrafted Word of God, then and only then will you see the true character of the heart.<br/>They will be without chastisement. They will be without correction. They will be without authority or submission to such. They will be bastards as Hebrews 12 says. Without accountability one to another. Remember, Adam and Eve loved the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It was pleasant, desirous, wanting. They were at peace there. They enjoyed it there. Only one problem. They died there!! So many times when people walk away from the AUTHORITY of the Word being<br/>preached and go to that NEW place as they call it. They will soon say, &quot;Oh we are so happy here. Our eyes have really been opened. We are free here!! Remember where Adam and Eve had their eyes OPENED. At the wrong tree. Jesus said in John 9:41 to the Pharisees, &quot;Because you say you SEE, your sin remains&quot;. Will you justify the flesh? Will you find<br/>all the excuses to appease the soul? Or will you be determined to stay anchored in sound doctrine? It is so easy to say you love Jesus, and it is so easy to say you love the Word of God, UNTIL a demand is put on you contrary to what you believe. Then you will find out just how much you do love the Word. Then you will find out just how much you do love HIM.<br/>In a day when stress, strife and pressure seem to be all around us, many are finding their escape in entertainment, social outings and the easy street. Our churches are filled with Hollywood entertainers, carnality, plays, dramas and concerts. But where is the fire of the Word of God? We have churches who get one crowd in and out in one hour, just to get the next crowd in for their hour. The preacher and the service will be identical to the first. Where is the Holy Spirit? Come to this place. We will get you out in time for football!! Do not worry. Bring your friends here. We offend no one. I do not ever see Paul or Silas or Timothy filling an amphitheater to put on a PASSION PLAY, live with donkeys and palm branches!! I do not see Paul having the star of the Corinth globetrotters or the running back of the Ephesian Cowboys as his<br/>special guest to promote his ministry. I see Paul turning a world upside down. I see Paul being whipped, beaten and stoned for thepreaching of the true gospel. It is easy to find the place of your comfort, if you allow your soul to run your life. Or you can find the place of crucifixion to the flesh. Death to self, daily dying and a hunger to fellowship with HIS sufferings. You can believe in Christ as Savior, or surrender to Jesus as LORD!! To whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life!! Revival or Repentance? What do you think God is calling for? Revival or Perilous times? What do you think the Bible has to say? People laughing in Toronto and Florida as they bark at each other like dogs, or holiness? What is our Father in heaven crying over? Apostasy or Apology? Which should we offer unto HIM? I<br/>hear men crying revival, revival, revival. I hear God crying repentance, repentance, repentance. The distant thunder on the horizonis not what many think. While they are eating, drinking, marrying and given in marriage, the Lamb of God is about to return. Will he find faith in the earth? To whom shall we go? And when the disciples walked with him no more, it is found in John 6:66. 666 the number of man. Think about it.<br/><br/>Have a wonderful day,<br/><br/>- Kim
