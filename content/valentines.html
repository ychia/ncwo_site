		Praise the Lord and God bless all of you reading this today.  Please go and get your Bibles right now so that during this teaching, you will be able to PROVE all things as to whether what is spoken comes from the doctrines of men or the teachings of Jesus Christ.  Please know that your spiritual life is always to be built on &#x201c;What saith the scriptures&#x201d; and not on flesh and blood.  I would pray with all my heart that you would read EACH and EVERY scripture written in this teaching so the Holy Spirit can minister truth to your hearts.  May our Father be glorified this day.<br/><br/><br/>1 Thes. 5:21<br/><br/>    Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. <br/><br/>            The word, &#x201c;prove&#x201d; in the Greek, means to test, try, EXAMINE and discern ALL things!<br/><br/>Acts 17:11<br/><br/>    These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.<br/><br/>            The word &#x201c;searched&#x201d; in the Greek means to, investigate, interrogate, SCRUTINIZE and judge. From these foundational scriptures, we learn that as disciples of Jesus Christ, we are to test, try, examine, discern, investigate, interrogate, scrutinize and judge ALL THINGS to find out what truly is of God and what we are to partake of or NOT partake of.<br/><br/>            Our lives in the Christian faith are not based upon our emotions, views, opinions or our own desires.  Our lives and faith are not built upon Christianity and all its religious orders, denominations and foolish deeds.  Rather, our lives are to be built upon the foundation of Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh.  The relationship we have to the Word of God shall determine our eternal destiny.<br/><br/>1 Cor. 3:10-11<br/><br/>    According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. [11] For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>             We are first told we MUST be Born-Again to see the Kingdom of God.  The Children of God, known as the Church in the Bible, were never put in categories to be labeled.  We are called to be Born-Again INTO the Kingdom of God.  Not Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Assemblies of God, Word of Faith, Charismatic or Pentacostal.     Each of every one of these orders can NOT be traced back to Calvary&#x2019;s Cross, but rather to some human being in flesh and blood.  Each and every denomination in &#x201c;Christianity&#x201d; can be traced back to some person who started those movements.  For this cause, Jesus Christ nor his Apostles ever preached Christianity.  They preached the Kingdom of God!<br/><br/>Col. 2:8<br/><br/>    Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.<br/><br/>Col. 2:22<br/><br/>    Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?<br/><br/>Matthew 15:9<br/><br/>    But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.<br/><br/>            Once saved and Born-Again, we read we are ONLY Born-Again by the Word of God.  Once Born-Again by the Word of God, we are called to become DISCIPLES of Jesus Christ and disciplined in all truth and obedience to that truth.  Our eyes, heart and thoughts are not to be upon men, but on the Son of God who saved us and gave us the truth&#x2014;The Word of God.<br/><br/>John 3:3<br/><br/>    Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.<br/><br/>John 3:7<br/><br/>    Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.<br/><br/>1 Peter 1:22-23<br/><br/>    Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: [23] Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.<br/><br/>            With this foundation now laid for us by the Word of God, let us now do as we are commanded by our Father in Heaven to do.  First, the Lord just instructed us to PURIFY our souls in obeying the truth.  Obedience brings purity, amen.  Let us PROVE, TEST, TRY, EXAMINE and SCRUTINIZE by the Scriptures this observance called &#x201c;Valentine&#x2019;s Day&#x201d;.  IS this something innocent?  Is this just a simple observance of a day chosen to share loving feelings and give something sweet to someone?  Just how innocent is this?  Should we as adults even partake of this, let alone our precious children? Let us go and search the scriptures and allow the Holy Spirit to reveal the truth behind this observance!  After all, the Bible tells us as children of God that we are NOT to be moved by what we see, but rather the unseen.  That is the Spiritual realm we are to discern.<br/><br/>VALENTINE&#x2019;S DAY:<br/><br/>            Each year on February 14th countless millions of people celebrate a day known as &#x201c;St. Valentine&#x2019;s Day.&#x201d; Millions of heart-shaped cards and boxes of chocolates are given as gifts, and even churches have Valentine parties on this so-called &#x201c;Day of Love.&#x201d;  In schools, from pre-school and kindergarten on up, children draw names from a box and exchange heart-shaped notes which &#x201c;pair off&#x201d; the children as Valentine partners and it is said to be &#x201c;all in fun.&#x201d; People of all ages get into the act, and the words that are heard everywhere on that day are, &#x201c;Be My Valentine.&#x201d; <br/><br/>            The sad fact is that most people never question the origin of the customs that they involve themselves with.  Most people do not ask questions but do what everybody else does, never stopping to   consider how the Almighty God of Heaven feels about their activities.  We do what we were taught as children ourselves and pass these observances off now to our children only because that is what we have always known.   Yet, again, so many never question or ask or even seek out the scriptures like they are called to do as Christians to see what our Father in Heaven would show us.   When we consider that Valentine&#x2019;s Day is a day of preoccupation with the heart, it is essential that we listen to the following words spoken by the Holy Spirit to us in the Word of God.<br/><br/>Jeremiah 17:9-10 <br/><br/>&#x201c;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his wages, and according to the fruit of his doings.&#x201d;<br/><br/>            We must always remember that Satan appears as an Angel of Light, which means in ALL deceptiveness, he brings forth issues that ALWAYS appear and seem to be so innocent.  These issues that appear to have no harm or appear to be so innocent MUST be tested by those who exercise spiritual discernment.  Remember again that Satan operates in the realm of the spirit to bring us into natural issues we do that many times grieve God.  Our lives are to exemplify Jesus Christ, NOT the world.  We are called to be a &#x201c;peculiar people&#x201d; and &#x201c;royal priesthood&#x201d;, not like everyone else. We are called to come OUT from amongst the unclean and touch them not.   We must remember saints we are taught that Satan is the &#x201c;god&#x201d; of this world and the spirit that works IN the children of disobedience.  We must, in the fear of God, examine our own hearts daily to see whether we be IN the faith, which only comes by hearing the Word of God.  Yet in innocence comes ignorance and in ignorance comes damnation IF we know not truth.<br/><br/>Hosea 4:6<br/><br/>    My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.<br/><br/>1 Cor. 12:1<br/>

		<br/>    Now concerning spiritual, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.<br/><br/>            When we think of how we were all brought up as children with issues like Valentine&#x2019;s Day, Easter and Christmas, who would have ever thought that these simple, innocent celebrations would truly violate the Word of God and grieve our Father in Heaven?  We are commanded saints over and over again to NEVER learn the ways of the Heathen.  We are commanded that as true Born-Again believers, we are to abstain from the world, ways of the world and customs of the world.<br/><br/>John 18:36<br/><br/>    Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.<br/><br/>Romans 12:2<br/><br/>    And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<br/><br/>            The word &#x201c;conformed&#x201d; here means to be molded, fashioned, formed or shaped.  When the Holy Spirit reveals truth, we are called to repent (Change our way of thinking) and now line up with the Holy Scriptures).  We come to learn WHY Easter was NEVER celebrated in the Bible and WHY Easter had nothing to do with the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  We come to learn that Jesus was NOT crucified on a Friday and thus even &#x201c;Good Friday Celebrations&#x201d; are all man made.  We learn that Easter actually comes from the word ISHTAR, which was the goddess of sexual promiscuity in the Babylonian Culture, condemned by God.  This is why you have Easter bunnies (the animal always bearing offspring so quickly) and eggs which symbolize fertility and thus bunnies and eggs for Easter celebrations. <br/><br/>            In Egypt her name was OESTER and in Assyria, Ashteroth.   Note all the similarities of these goddess names to Easter.  Then we find out that Christ-mass was a Roman Catholic celebration that brought shame to God in Heaven, blasphemed Jesus Christ and mocked the blood sacrifice for our sins with a MASS for CHRIST.  Later this abomination became known as Christ&#x2014;Mass.  Then we find out about Valentine&#x2019;s Day.<br/><br/>            This so called innocent, simple little day is full of idolatry, lasciviousness and carnal fleshly lust.  The very fact of taking little boys and little girls and instilling in their young innocent hearts the thoughts of boys going to girls and girls going to boys for innocent love is forbidden again by the Word of God.  As parents and children of God, we are called to dedicate our lives to TRAIN UP a child in the way he or she shall go.  We are commanded by God to create IN our children a hunger and thirst for righteousness.  We are commanded by God that from the rising in the morning to going to bed at night, we are to instruct our children in the ways of God.<br/><br/>Proverbs 22:6<br/><br/>    Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.<br/><br/>Deut. 6:6-7<br/><br/>    And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: [7] And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.<br/><br/>            Remember the cute little plump cherubim angel boy during Valentine&#x2019;s Day?  He sits there with his cute little wings, plump cheeks and belly and holds that cute little Bow and Arrow in his hand.  He is called &#x201c;Cupid&#x201d; and he shoots his love arrow into the heart of young boys and girls to put a love spell on them.  What this innocent love spell is saints is fleshly carnal lust being instilled into the mind and thoughts and hearts of your young child.  This little disguised creature in his innocence is the same spirit behind Mistletoe at Christ-mass season.  In the Bible we read this:<br/><br/>Col. 3:5<br/><br/>    Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:<br/><br/>1 Thes. 4:5<br/><br/>    Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:<br/><br/>            Now saints, PLEASE, open your eyes and spiritual heart here.  Let us take a VERY serious look at this word &#x201c;concupiscence&#x201d; in the Greek.  Remember the Holy Spirit wrote this for YOU and ME!<br/><br/>Here is what this word means in the Greek:  It is the word &#x201c;epithumia&#x201d; which comes from the root word &#x201c;epithumeo&#x201d;.  Here are the adjectives describing this word: a longing for something that is forbidden; a desire; to LUST AFTER; to set the HEART UPON something.  Now look above again at the scriptures where this word is used in the Bible.  Not ONLY do you see &#x201c;concupiscence&#x201d; but what goes with it?   First, you see EVIL!  Second you see LUST!            Now, saints, do the scriptures speak in vain?  Are we called to brush this off and say &#x201c;No big deal&#x201d;?  Are we to allow the carnal minded to say this is legalism?<br/><br/>1 Cor. 2:14<br/><br/>    But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.<br/><br/>            We are commanded by God to use spiritual discernment and we are to mature and grow to be able to SPIRITUALLY JUDGE all things.  Now, please note the word &#x201c;CONCUPISCENCE&#x201d;.  From this word comes the word CUPID!!  This word in the Greek means to long for, to lust for, to desire.  The Bible says it is EVIL and LUSTFUL.  Therefore, you now have proof that this little cherubim called CUPID, is evil, lustful and the SPIRIT behind Valentine&#x2019;s Day is now being exposed.  Oh, Praise the name of the living God for HIS truth sets us free!  Now Cupid was known in Roman Mythology as the son of Venus who was the goddess of love and sexual fertility.  To the Greeks, Cupid was known as the son of Aphrodite, named Eros, from which &#x201c;Erotic&#x201d; comes from.  Thus from Aphrodite comes Aphrodisiacs to heighten sexual pleasure and erotic comes from Eros and all this lies in Cupid disguised.  <br/><br/>Romans 8:13<br/><br/>    For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.<br/><br/>Col. 3:5<br/><br/>    Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:<br/><br/>            Notice how God forbid this among his people.  This is what Valentine&#x2019;s Day is all about!!  In sweet innocence we burn our children in the fires of Molech and turn them onto lust.  How grievously sad this is.  Oh, that those reading this should rejoice in Spirit and give thanksgiving unto God for ministries like New Covenant Christian Center that are willing to sacrifice the sweet exaltations of men, by speaking truth.  Jesus said, &#x201c;Woe be unto you when all men speak well of you&#x201d;.  I thank the Lord that we at New Covenant Christian Center love our children enough to teach them the fear of God and to expose these unfruitful works of darkness.  IF your children attend our Pre-School or Christian School, I would pray you give thanks this day that you have them in a place where the Holy Word of God is exalted.<br/>

		<br/>            We do not condemn any who observe these things, nor cut them away, but rather love enough to teach truth.  Yet for this cause, we do not observe these here in our school or on these grounds.  We only pray that all would come to the knowledge of truth.   Even though we be criticized by so many, many spat and condemned the greatest man of truth also&#x2014;Jesus Christ.   People who call themselves Born-Again Christians are so full of carnality and ignorance today that they can not see spiritually the depth of this wickedness. Remember again, Satan does NOT appear in this world with pitchfork, tail and horns.  He appears as an Angel of light by getting people to observe things that are against the laws of God.<br/><br/>            Christians should be known by their discernment and should be asking questions regarding Valentine&#x2019;s Day.  What is the origin of this unusual day?  Why is there a preoccupation with the color red?  Where did the heart shape come from, and what does it mean?  In this life, WHY is there such a day and what does it have to do with me and my family?  Be not conformed to this world Jesus said. These and other questions will now be answered, as we examine the roots and pagan origin of this popular day.<br/><br/>THE ORIGIN OF VALENTINE&#x2019;S DAY:<br/><br/>            In the days of the Roman Empire, the month of February was the last and shortest month of the year.  February originally had 30 days, but when Julius Caesar named the month of July after himself, he decided to make that month longer and shortened February to 29 days while making July a month of 31 days.  Later when Octavius Caesar, also known as Augustus, came to power, he named the month of August after himself, and not to be outdone he also subtracted a day from February and gave the month of August 31 days. To this very day it remains that way.<br/><br/>            The ancient Romans believed that every month had a spirit that gained in strength and reached its peak or apex of power in the middle of the month or&#x201d;ides&#x201d; of the month.  This was usually the 15th day, and it was a day when witches and augurs, or soothsayers worked their magic. An augur was a person filled with a spirit of divination, and from the word augur we get the word &#x201c;inaugurate&#x201d;, which means to &#x201c;take omens&#x201d;.  Since February had been robbed by Caesars and now had only 28 days, the Ides of February became the 14th day of that month. Since the Ides of a month was celebrated on the preceding eve, the month of February was unique, because it was the 13th day that became the eve of the Ides that month, and it became a very important pagan holiday in the Empire of Rome.<br/><br/>            The sacred day of February 14th was called &#x201c;Lupercalia&#x201d; or &#x201c;day of the wolf.&#x201d;  This was a day that was sacred to the sexual frenzy of the goddess Juno. This day also honored the Roman gods, Lupercus and Faunus, as well as the legendary twin brothers, who supposedly founded Rome, Remus and Romulus. These two are said to have been suckled by wolves in a cave on Palatine Hill in Rome. The cave was called Lupercal and was the center of the celebrating on the eve of Lupercalia or February 14th.  On this day, Lupercalia, which was later named Valentine&#x2019;s Day, the Luperci or priests of Lupercus dressed in goatskins for a bloody ceremony. The priests of Lupercus, the wolf god, would sacrifice goats and a dog and then smear themselves with blood. These priests, made red with sacrificial blood, would run around Palatine Hill in a wild frenzy while carving a goatskin thong called a &#x201c;februa.&#x201d; Women would sit all around the hill, as the bloody priests would strike them with the goatskin thongs to make them fertile. The young women would then gather in the city and their names were put in boxes. These &#x201c;love notes&#x201d; were called &#x201c;billets.&#x201d; The men of Rome would draw a billet, and the woman whose name was on it became his sexual lust partner with whom he would fornicate until the next Lupercalia or February 14th.<br/><br/>            Thus, February 14th became a day of unbridled sexual lust. The color &#x201c;red&#x201d; was sacred to that day because of the blood and the &#x201c;heart shape&#x201d; that is popular to this day, its design came from this origin.   Now, please do not be offended, but the heart-shape was not a representation of the human heart, for the human heart looks NOTHING like the heart shape used in Valentine&#x2019;s Day cards, cut outs or candy boxes.   This shape of a heart, represents the human female matrix (uterus) or opening to what they called &#x201c;the chamber of sacred copulation&#x201d;.  THIS is your Valentine&#x2019;s Day root and beginning!  Thus, the very foundation upon which this heathen and pagan celebration originated, was to have hearts filled to embrace lust to fornicate with a love partner to procreate life in a disgusting fashion.<br/><br/>            When the Gnostic Catholic Church began to get a foothold in Rome around the 3rd century A.D., they became known as Valentinians.  The Catholic  Valentinians retained the sexual license of the festival in what they called &#x201c;angels in a nuptial chamber&#x201d;, which was also called the &#x201c;sacrament of copulation.&#x201d; This was said to be a reenactment of the marriage of &#x201c;Sophia and the Redeemer.&#x201d; As the participants of the February 14th ritual began their sexual sacrament, presided over and watched by the priests known as Valentinians, the following literary was spoken: &#x201c;Let the seed of light descend into thy bridal chamber, receive the bridegroom&#x2026; open thine arms to embrace him. Behold, grace has descended upon thee&#x201d;.  As time went on, the Orthodox Church suppressed the Gnostic Catholics and manufactured &#x201c;St. Valentine&#x201d;, whose day continues to be celebrated in these modern times.<br/><br/>            It should be without saying that true Christians, those that love Jesus Christ and desire to be HIS disciples, should avoid Valentine&#x2019;s Day and expose it for what it is.  We should be used by God to witness and share with those around us the depth of this perverse and sexually promiscuous observance.  We should rejoice in truth and thank God for delivering us from such filthy observances.  In wisdom, teach your children truth, in that this holiday has nothing to do with Jesus Christ and for that cause, we shall not partake.  In time, as they get older, you can share more with them as you feel led.   In God&#x2019;s eyes, it is still &#x201c;Lupercalia&#x201d;, the &#x201c;Day Of The Wolf.&#x201d;  Men become wolves, as they carry on the Satanic rituals of fornication, which means sexual intercourse without marriage.  When men look upon pretty women and lust for them, many times they give a whistle.  Is that not true?  I can not put in words the sound of this whistle, but most adults today know what I am saying.  Do you know WHAT this whistle is called?  It is called a &#x201c;wolf whistle&#x201d;, and we all know that wolves do not whistle. It is lustful men and women, who carry on Satan&#x2019;s blasphemy to this very day.<br/>            In conclusion, we must ask ourselves, &#x201c;Should a true Christian be associated in any way with this celebration of evil roots? Should we be doing what the heathen have done for so many years and try to justify it as love?&#x201d; Romans 12:2 answers this very well, &#x201c;And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind&#x2026;&#x201d;<br/><br/>            Praise God that we at New Covenant Christian Center, Int&#x2019;l expose these unfruitful works of darkness.  Thank God we take a stand on these issues and teach our children truth.  Thank God we keep our children pure in heart and keep the evil one from them.  Thank God we instruct our teachers to instruct our children to instruct their parents that we will NOT observe this heathen, pagan, evil celebration.  How sad that parents have actually walked away from our Pre-School, Christian School and ministry here because we teach truth about Valentine&#x2019;s Day, Easter, Christ-Mass and Birthdays.  I would pray you check out our web page sometime and be blessed with the teachings.  I only ask ONE thing.  Make sure your Bible is by your side and opened to prove all things.
