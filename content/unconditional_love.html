			<h2>The Unconditional Love of our Father in Heaven</h2>

		<div class="clearfix"></div>

		Beloved Saints of the Kingdom of God; Praise the Lord and God bless you this day. I pray your week has truly been more fulfilling than those before, in that each week we grow from glory to glory. I greet you all this day in the mercy, grace and peace multiplied of our Father in heaven and our Lord Jesus Christ.<br/> <br/>What I am about to write, will NOT be easy for me to put into words, so I would only ask you bow your head and PRAY and ask the Holy Spirit to reveal the &quot;revelations&quot; behind this word I will share with you. I would ask saints you READ each and EVERY scripture as you go through this letter today, for they build and TEACH you what the Holy Spirit desires YOU to get ahold of within. WE are called to be BORN AGAIN saints in all holiness, righteousness and as I Jn. 3, says, those born of God do NOT COMMIT and live in sin. If you read this letter and just PASS over the scriptures, you will receive NOTHING from the Lord. I will do all I can to take what is IN my heart and spirit and bring it to light for all to see. I will try to put into words, what God desires for us to EMBRACE in Spirit. I want to share about the &quot;UNCONDITIONAL LOVE&quot; of our Father in Heaven. As I wrote earlier today, about our wonderful weekend and profound day on Sunday, I was tired after I sent it and I laid down to rest. My body has surely suffered much in those six months in Africa and I was far spent, physically, emotionally and spiritually when I came home. These past two months, have been also, very pressing on me.<br/> <br/>As I laid down to rest today, suddenly I felt the overwhelming presence of the Holy Spirit upon my heart and soul. I could &quot;hear&quot; that still inner voice of the Spirit, speaking of HIS pleasure in the TRUTH we are continually hearing. I could hear the Holy Spirit encouraging ME to continue teaching all I do, and allowing HIM to minister life to all who have ears to hear. I could hear that still voice saying, IT TAKES strength and humility to speak the truth IN LOVE, for many will despise and reject you, as they did Jesus Christ. The Spirit then said,  &quot;My people believe, but do they KNOW&quot;? <br/> <br/>Suddenly, the Spirit FLOODED my mind with thoughts, order, purpose, and the love of our Father in heaven. Saints, think of this. When we think of the &quot;UNCONDITIONAL LOVE&quot; of our Father in Heaven, it is so HARD to conceive in thought, that with such LOVE, people perish in HELL, for eternity by Judgment. Yet that is because, Satan created Christianity and in so doing, broke down the power of Kingdom authority. He brought in a gospel that is NOT the gospel of Jesus Christ, has WE know it through the Apostolic and Prophetic.(Read II Cor. 11)  For this cause, MANY will perish saints, for they MISUNDERSTAND truth. They allow SIN, allow disobedience, and PERMIT sin without Godly, tears of weepings for repentance, because they confuse Grace and mercy, with Judgments of God. We are commanded saints to FEAR God, KEEP HIS commandments, and ABHOR EVIL. Yet today, how many Christians TRULY abhor evil? How many live in rebellion, yet cry out LOVE, LOVE, LOVE???<br/> <br/>How could an &quot;UNCONDITIONAL LOVE of our Father in Heaven&quot; send people to an eternal hell? The answer is, men send THEMSELVES by denying the VERY love God sent to save them!!  It was God's LOVE that saved us.  God put a GREAT PRICE on our lives, the blood of HIS son. The BLOOD of Jesus Christ was shed saints in agony, pain, suffering, for OUR sins, yet we SIN with no fear, no repentance, no tears, no weeping&#x2019;s.<br/> <br/>Hebrews 10:26-31 <br/>    For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, [27] But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. [28] He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: [29] Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? [30] For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. [31] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.<br/><br/>

		God HATES sin saints, and ONLY for this cause  HE SENT HIS SON to DIE and pay a price for our sins. IF WE SIN WILFULLY after the knowledge of truth, the ONLY way we are cleansed is to repent and SIN NO MORE. The Love of God FORGIVES us Saints, IF we go and sin no more AND obey where HE says we must go. What incredible LOVE Jesus showed ALL, in Jn. 8, when he forgave and said, GO AND SIN NO MORE. I have to believe saints, this is what we are to see today. God's love for us does NOT judge our sins, IF we repent and openly confess that sin and allow HIS love to cleanse. BUT if we take sin lightly, only give that little, &quot;I am sorry&quot; then worldly sorrow worketh death Paul said.<br/>Notice above here saints, God SO loved us, he gave us the BLOOD of Jesus, and when we sin, rebel, disobey, we TRODDEN underfoot the Son of God, and we count the  BLOOD that sanctified us, an UNHOLY THING, and we INSULT The Holy Spirit of Grace (salvation). Oh, please Selah on that scripture saints. Therefore, this LOVING, KIND, TENDER, GENTLE, Father in heaven, DOES HAVE a vengeance saints, that belongs to HIM and HE WILL Recompense and JUDGE HIS people. Would you rather HEAR truth TODAY, be rebuked, chastened and fear God to repentance, OR think you can go on YOUR way in life, until THAT day?  Can you see the dilemma many face and struggle with?? HOW can the &quot;UNCONDITIONAL LOVE of our Father in Heaven&quot;, have VENGEANCE and judgment????? God never sinned and his LOVE is perfect and PERFECT LOVE casts OUT fear. So God's love does not leave us, WE leave HIS love. Selah.<br/> <br/>It is because of what SIN truly is. Ever since Sunday saints, I have been pondering and pondering over and over again, those verses in Ezekiel 11 and 36. Forgive me in my last letter, for I wrote chapter 13 in Ezekiel when I meant 36. Saints, it is because of SIN and the depth of how our Father sees sin, that the BLOOD of Jesus is measured in our lives. .<br/> <br/>Ezekiel 36:25-31 <br/>    Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. [26] A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. [27] And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. [28] And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. [29] I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. [30] And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen. [31] Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.<br/> <br/>Saints, PLEASE read that whole chapter again, which I shared much from on Sunday. God LOVES US SO MUCH, he sent HIS son, to shed HIS blood to cover OUR sins, so we could COME INTO HIS PRESENCE saints, pure, clean, and sanctified!!!!  He will sprinkle clean water (HIS WORD) to clean us from OUR FILTHINESS!!!!  Now saints, THAT is love and HE did it FOR us, because HE loved us. BUT saints, what a hurtful and painful heart God has when HIS own people sin, continue in sin, disobey, and then do NOT repent completely. HOW can we come into the presence of a loving and HOLY God, with the dirtiness and filth of the world and carnality abounding within? God said HE would put a NEW heart in us, and a NEW spirit in us, so we would WALK in Godly statutes, KEEP HIS judgments and DO DO DO them!!  God said above HE would SAVE us from our UNCLEANESS!! THAT IS LOVE saints,  but, what if we SIN, despise the blood, commit iniquities?  Does HIS love change? Absolutely NOT. The &quot;UNCONDITIONAL LOVE of our Father in Heaven&quot; will never cease toward us, but HIS ANGER shall be released in judgment, IF we trodden under foot HIS SON and insult the Holy Spirit in our rebellion and take the blood lightly. . Notice how this chapter above ends.<br/> <br/>[31] Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.<br/>THEN shall YOU remember, REMEMBER, your OWN evil ways, and YOUR doings that were NOT good, and shall LOATHE yourselves in YOUR OWN SIGHT saints, for your iniquities and YOUR abominations. WHY would a loving, caring, Almighty God and our Father in heaven WANT that? Why would God want US to see all this within? For the SAME reason HE showed Moses the leprosy in his heart, which I again spoke of Sunday. When YOU allow God to gain entry to YOUR heart, by TRULY pressing in, TRULY hating this world, TRULY abhorring evil, TRULY removing yourself from ungodly, unsaved people, TRULY coming out from unclean ways and HITTING YOUR KNEES and fasting and praying, THEN you shall see true sin within. God wants us to see this, so we shall SEE saints, KNOW saints, UNDERSTAND saints, in our hearts the reality of SIN and what it does. ONLY when you KNOW sin within, will you KNOW the Love God shed on you. I say that again, ONLY WHEN YOU KNOW SIN WITHIN&lt; WILL YOU KNOW THE LOVE GOD SHED ON YOU!!!   Do you have any idea HOW MANY so called Christians today take sin SO LIGHTLY???  It means nothing to them and when God reaches OUT with truth, forgiveness and SETS ORDER for repentance, they just say Oh, SORRY GOD, I made a mistake and go on. That saints, will NOT make it right with God.<br/>

		<img style="margin: 10px; display: block; float: right;" src="img/ark2.png"/>

		 <br/>I as laid down today, resting in peace, I could see Jesus, IN SPIRIT, sitting at the right hand of God saints, where HE IS right now. So many times, we just live our daily lives, without REALLY REALIZING the reality of what life is out there. Saints, this world is a world of gross darkness, iniquities, sins abounding. It is a world filled with seducing spirits and powers that be, UNSEEN. UNSEEN saints. Those you work with, your bosses, co workers, have SPIRITS saints, which control their lives. These spirits are devilish, demonic and I do NOT CARE how nice MR, Nice guy is, if he be not saved, he is of the devil. They lust and breath lusts toward women of God, and look upon them casting EVIL toward them.  They are around us everywhere, and THIS IS WHY, God says COME OUT FROM AMONGST THE UNGODLY, the UNCLEAN and THEN, THEN, THEN, I will be your Father and YOU shall be my sons and daughters--II Cor.6:18. Oh, Saints, PLEASE see holiness here. WE can NOT come to the Father UNCLEAN, tainted, unholy, and uncleansed!!! <br/> <br/>WHY are we taught and told Jesus sits at the right hand of the Father, MEDIATING for us? DO WE really ever take the time DAILY to see this IN Spirit?  Right now, as you read this, Jesus IS alive, sitting AT the right hand of God, MEDIATING for you and me. What is Jesus doing? PRAYING, INTERCEDING saints, that we WILL OBEY HIS VOICE and love him as HE LOVES us. HE is praying we will NOT be deceived and blinded by Satan, the master of deception and deceit.  For without HOLINESS and without OBEDIENCE, the love of the Father can NOT be in us. WHY would Jesus Christ be doing this? Because of the &quot;UNCONDITIONAL LOVE of our Father in Heaven&quot;.<br/> <br/>1 Tim. 2:5 <br/>    For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;<br/> <br/>Saints, this word MEDIATOR means a GO BETWEEN an INTERCESSOR. Many times, we give no thought to this, NOR to the extent upon which Jesus Christ DAILY, every moment, of time, intercedes for US, his chosen body, by salvation in being born again. We also hear this scripture, but NEVER seem to look at the fullness of this chapter. Selah on this, that from this verse in 5 to the end of the chapter, the Holy Spirit takes us FROM Jesus praying FOR us, right to holy men, holy women in HOW they dress, right down to Adam, Eve and childbearing!!!! Selah on that today saint, for in that lies the eternal Kingdom. Men are to be men of PRAYER and women are to be women OF HOLINESS in dress, sobriety, shamefacedness and not whoredoms to attract lustful eyes of wolves in men. He then talks about Adam, Eve, and child bearing. This means saints, God is talking about FAMILY, husbands, wives, children. When was Satan FIRST mentioned in the Bible? Right after Adam and Eve came together in love and were married. When did Satan come to tempt Eve? Right after Adam blessed her as his wife. Satan destroys families and God FIGHTS to keep them together. Then he talks about childbearing. NOW he goes to our children. SO JESUS is mediating in heaven right now for husbands, wives, children. He wants men holy, women GODLY and dressing shamefacedly to NOT attract wolves and he wants our children and youth HOLY and in subjection. Selah today and let the Spirit reveal this to YOU. Some of you in our body, are right now SEEING a renewed love in your homes and marriages because of what is being taught and you are getting on your knees and SEEING life. This is Jesus Christ!!  Saints, THIS is how much God loves us. WHY do we not take to heart this love?  Why do we insist on loving God OUR way? <br/> <br/>1 Tim. 2:4-15 <br/>    Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. [5] For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; [6] Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. [7] Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. [8] I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. [9] In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; [10] But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. [11] Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. [12] But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. [13] For Adam was first formed, then Eve. [14] And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. [15] Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.<br/><br/>So God goes from his SON Jesus praying for us, salvation of mankind, men, women, Adam, Eve and bearing children. Now saints, God so LOVED the world, that HE gave, yes GAVE, offered up, HIS only begotten son, Jesus Christ. For WHILE we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. <br/>Father's,  Mother&#x2019;s, Jesus is INTERCEDING for your children. Men, Jesus is praying for YOU to be holy and women, Jesus is praying for YOU to be PURE. Husbands, Jesus is praying for you to honor your wives and Wives, Jesus is praying for YOU to reverence your husbands. THIS is the Kingdom saints, and THIS is the &quot;UNCONDITIONAL LOVE of our Father in Heaven&quot;, for HE knows Satan is here!!  Now can you all understand WHY I have shared from BEFORE I went to Africa to coming BACK from Africa, why God wants OUR families on their knees together, in prayer, standing AGAINST the wiles of the devil? I pray so. God SO LOVED us, HE SENT Jesus to destroy the works of SATAN. Why do we let that evil sinful spirit back INTO our lives?<br/> <br/>John 3:16 <br/>    For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br/><br/>Here is where Satan invented CHRISTIANITY!!  Men preach, just love Jesus, for HE loves you and IF YOU BELIEVE in him you go to heaven. NOT SO SAINTS. you can NOT just believe in Jesus. This word believe in the Greek means: TO HAVE FAITH IN, to respect, to credit, to ENTRUST one's spiritual being to, to PUT IN TRUTH with. Saints did you SEE that? Do you GET it?  For GOD SO LOVED the world, HE gave his son Jesus Christ, offered his BLOOD for our sins, that WHOSOEVER, &quot;believeth&quot; (HAS FAITH IN, RESPECTS, CREDITS, ENTRUSTS ONES LIFE TO, PUTS TRUST IN) shall be saved!!!!!!!!!  <br/> <br/>Romans 5:8-11 <br/>    But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. [9] Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. [10] For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. [11] And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.<br/><br/>Oh, LORD, saints, PLEASE SEE THIS IN YOUR HEARTS TODAY. I cry for you to see this!  This whole verse above talks about the BLOOD OF JESUS!!!  For while we were YET SINNERS, Christ DIED for us (Bloodshed).  Where did Jesus die? In Gethsemane for OUR WILLS TO DIE, by shedding blood and AT CALVARY'S CROSS!!!  We are justified BY HIS BLOOD!!  We are SAVED FROM WRATH, saved from what saints? From WRATH, BY HIS BLOOD!!  We were reconciled back to God, BY HIS BLOOD!!! Yet we ALSO JOY IN GOD, through our Lord Jesus Christ, BY HIS BLOOD of atonement. Both Gethsemane and Calvary saints. Shall we trodden UNDER foot that blood? God forbid. God SO LOVED us saints and SO LOVES US, he even has Jesus right NOW praying for US and HE put the Holy Spirit IN US to help us overcome OUR WILL, OBEY, love each other and forgive each other!!<br/>

		 <br/>NOW do you understand WHY we are judged IF we trodden under foot HIS BLOOD??  The &quot;UNCONDITIONAL LOVE of our Father in Heaven&quot; came from HIM to US, because he hated sin and what Satan did. BUT what IF WE allow Satan to take us into sin? What if we ALLOW Satan to destroy our marriages, homes, children, because of SIN?  Will NOT judgment come? Absolutely. This is why SO many today; cry LOVE LOVE LOVE, but not Judgment, Judgment, Judgment. The Blood of Jesus is SACRED saints, and not taken lightly. If we sin, REPENT!!  And when you repent, YOU CAN NOT continue on what path you were on when you sinned. YOU GO BACK to where you went astray, THEN start again with those works. THAT is HIS love for us.<br/> <br/>You know Saints, so many today, have NO revelation of the depth of SIN or how much God hates sin. We have forgotten the FEAR OF GOD and have forgotten how terrible we USED to feel when we sinned. Now it just comes and goes, not big deal. IT IS A VERY big issue with God. As I grow older, I see more and more of this and the fear of God GROWS in my heart. God is NOT to be taken lightly, NOR HIS love. NEVER forget saints, the &quot;UNCONDITIONAL LOVE of our Father in Heaven&quot;, IS UNCONDITIONAL, but HIS promises ARE CONDITIONAL. They ARE conditional saints. Jesus said IF you love me OBEY. IF you love me and keep MY sayings my Father will abide in HIS love in you. IF you do NOT obey, then you know not me, Jesus said. Peter said IF THESE THINGS abide IN YOU, an entry is made into the eternal Kingdom.<br/> <br/>2 Peter 1:8-12 <br/>    For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. [9] But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. [10] Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: [11] For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. <br/>    [12] Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.<br/><br/>THIS is why saints, I am ALWAYS bringing you into REMEMBRANCE of things, to keep your hearts focused ON TRUTH. Notice how Peter was talking to BELIEVERS and they FORGOT how they were once PURGED from old sins. Peter said to GIVE DILIGENCE to make your calling and election SURE. The gifts and callings of God are without repentance, and ONCE called, YOU CAN NOT LEAVE that calling, less you leave God saints. IF YOU REMEMBER SUCH, repent, and GET RIGHT again with God, YOU SHALL NEVER fall. THEN an entrance shall be ministered in the everlasting Kingdom. Selah and Selah.<br/> <br/>IF you repent saints, IF you fear God saints, IF you have Godly sorrow to repentance, you shall be saved. YES, the love of God is UNCONDITIONAL for HE loved us from the moment Satan took man down. BUT God also gives us GUIDELINE and STATUTES and COMMANDMENTS saints, that we MUST obey. That is why we MUST be BORN AGAIN, a new creation in Christ. IF we sin. we repent and NEVER look back. Christ is AHEAD of us not behind. Satan is BEHIND us saints, always whispering lies, therefore, we need truth and HIS love. This is why the Holy Spirit ENCOURAGED ME today saints, to KEEP PREACHING TRUTH. I get down a lot, I get depressed saints, and I carry many lonely burdens. Yet, Today the Holy Spirit encouraged me to keep preaching OBEDIENCE and HOLINESS and FEAR.<br/> <br/>Today, Christians have a hard time trying to MERISMOS the &quot;Unconditional Love of our Father in Heaven&quot;, with JUDGMENT. People think because of LOVE and GRACE, it is no problem. That is EXACTLY what Satan wants you to think. That is EXACTLY what Satan wants you to believe. TAKE SIN LIGHTLY, claim grace AND love and go to heaven. Really?<br/> <br/>Ephes. 2:2 <br/>    Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:<br/> <br/>Ephes. 5:6 <br/>    Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.<br/> <br/>Col. 3:6 <br/>    For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:<br/><br/>Saints, the LOVE of God is precious, pure, holy, gentle, kind, tender, abides forever toward us, but thou shalt NOT tempt the Lord thy God. HIS love is UNCONDITIONAL and the more we obey, the MORE we know HIS love and the MORE we fear his LOVE and the more we KNOW him. Yet, saints, let us not take HIS LOVE and use it as a license to rebel. The MORE we obey, the MORE we KNOW HIS love and give THANKS for saving us and showing us the REAL sin within us.<br/> <br/>Rev. 2:1-5 <br/>    Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; [2] I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: [3] And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted. [4] Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. [5] Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.<br/>

		 <img style="margin: 10px; display: block; float: right;" src="img/lampstand.png"/>

		 <br/>HERE we have the &quot;UNCONDITIONAL LOVE of our Father in Heaven&quot;,  willing to FORGIVE us when we walk away from Jesus and backslide in life, but ALSO HIS judgment IF we do not repent saints and take the blood of Jesus seriously. Notice this verse well saints. Jesus was talking to the Church at Ephesus. Just read Ephesians and you will KNOW this church and who they were and who WE are to be. They labored, had patience, could NOT BEAR to be with them of evil in this world, tried men of God to SEE who were true Apostles or false, they fainted not. Yet the book of Ephesians is FILLED with Kingdom order, spirituals, Satan, disobedience, Apostles, Prophets, obedience, Husbands, Wives, relationships between them and the armor of God against Satan.<br/> <br/>Notice what Jesus said here saints, and this is important for YOU to learn to share with others out there backslidden, or away from Jesus or those who want to repent and return to Jesus. Jesus said, he had SOMEWHAT AGAINST thee, for thou has LEFT (forsaken, walked away, departed from) your first love (Jesus Christ which brought you into Kingdom salvation).  Jesus then said, REMEMBER (bring to memory, RECOLLECT MEMORY, thought) remember from WHENCE you are fallen, NOT FROM WHOM!! Jesus Christ said, when one leaves HIM, walks away from HIM, they must Recall, recollect from WHENCE (what place!! what state!! what location) you are fallen (taken away, taken off course, removed from) REPENT Jesus said, and then go do YOUR FIRST WORKS. That means saints, we MUST go back to where we fell from him, walked away from him, sinned against him, left him, and begin AGAIN with our first works, first meaning what you were doing before you walked away. ONLY then, are we back saints. Do we believe that? We better. God sends us home, to rebuild again in HIS LOVE, not condemnation. BUT if we do not obey, judgment comes. What about the Prodigal son?<br/> <br/>Here again is the &quot;UNCONDITIONAL LOVE of our Father in Heaven&quot;.   When the son repented, finally came to his senses, he did not say, OH I BLEW it, made a great mistake, God forgive me, and just went on trying to MAKE ENDS MEET his own way. HE WENT HOME saints. God SO LOVES us, SO loves us saints, that HE forgives us, cleanses us, sets us back RIGHT with HIM, but we must LEARN to do what HE says we must do to make it right. What is so awesome saints, is that LOVE COVERS a multitude of sins. TRUE LOVE forgives sins. I may hurt for many today, but I have NO ought nor unforgiveness. God hurts for many today, but HIS love will always be there waiting. Sadly, God loves ALL who perish. God so LOVES US saints, HE gave us HIS ONLY WORD, Jesus Christ. HIS love is so great, but God can NOT violate his will. Therefore, Jesus said IF we love Jesus, IF we love the Father, IF we love the Holy Spirit, WE will ALLOW HIM to work in us with HIS word to restore. Anything short and our repentance falls short and his LOVE abounds, but his LOVE can not usurp obedience. FOR THIS IS THE LOVE OF GOD, that we keep HIS commandments!!!<br/> <br/>1 John 5:3-4 <br/>    For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. [4] For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.<br/><br/>2 John 1:6 <br/>    And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.<br/><br/>Saints, HIS LOVE IS eternal, HIS love for us BLOSSOMS more and more in our hearts, and the MORE we love HIM, the MORE we feel the joy of our salvation. SIN kills the heart, kills the soul, kills the spirit and the DECEITFULNESS of sin hardens the heart. May we remember Ezekiel 11 and 36 saints, for God wants to PUT IN US a clean heart, soft, pliable and full of HIS life. Lastly, think of this. Jesus sits at the RIGHT HAND mediating for us. WHY saints? Because Satan is the god of this world, deceiving, destroying, manipulating, blinding, as an Angel of Light. Satan is taking MANY down in this hour, destroying homes. families, marriages. Would GOD in heaven ever destroy one of HIS families? Satan is turning youth in rebellion to parents, and turning their hearts to sin, YET our Father in heaven SO LOVES us, HE CRIES for our obedience and knees of prayer. So many, oh, so many sit today and they THINK they are right with God, when they REFUSE to hear HIS Word. Paul told us to NOT Be moved by the seen world, but the UNSEEN, why? <br/>

		 <br/>2 Cor. 4:18 <br/>    While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.<br/> <br/>Because IN the unseen world, is both LIGHT and DARKNESS, Satan and Jesus. One speaking to follow him (Satan) by getting you to do YOUR will, the other (Jesus) interceding to KEEP HIS WORD and hearken to those set over you in the Lord to PROTECT YOU!!  And notice the chapter above I just quoted. It is in that VERY chapter in the beginning verses where we see, the god of this world, the god of this world, who BLINDS and smokescreens (obscures) your vision. That is why Paul finished by saying be MOVED BY the unseen. In other words, KNOW SIN, KNOW REBELLION, KNOW YOUR ADVERSARY and KNOW JESUS, who gives you HIS WORD TO OBEY to overcome. BE not deceived saints, GOD IS NOT MOCKED and we shall reap what we sow.<br/> <br/><br/>Saints, YOUR FATHER IN HEAVEN LOVES you so much!!!  HIS beckoning cry in this day is OBEY HIM and let HIM PROTECT you. God wishes to see NO MAN perish, yet most will, and even Christians who REFUSE TO REPENT and go back to their FIRST LOVE, will be judged on that day with the LORD, LORD crowd. I surely fear THAT day saints. I check my heart DAILY to make sure I AM IN THE FAITH and NOT reprobate!!  II Cor. 13:4-5. Do not confuse God's eternal love with judgment, for you can NOT separate them. FAST, PRAY, be on your knees, cry out to God, cleanse your homes, your lives and get ready saints. THAT day is coming.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The &quot;UNCONDITIONAL LOVE of our Father in Heaven&quot;, is for ALL, yet WE must take it, receive it, HONOR it and obey. It shall NEVER change, but may we NOT fall short either of fearing HIM unto obedience. This is why the Holy Spirit blessed my heart as I lied down today, to ENCOURAGE ME saints, to keep speaking truth IN love, keep preaching HOLINESS, OBEDIENCE, FEAR and to warn the unruly, that THAT day is coming, but nonetheless, truth. I will warn all men, all women, of that which is to come. May we BE NOT deceived, for God is NOT mocked. May we HIT OUR KNEES and OBEY HIS VOICE and not think we can repent OUR way and expect the love of God to honor. WE honor HIM by obeying HIS voice, and I SURELY want to FEEL and KNOW, THE &quot;UNCONDITIONAL LOVE of MY Father in Heaven&quot;. Kim
