			<h2>Being Under the Blood</h2>
			<em>when Judgment comes</em>
		</div>
		<div class="clearfix"></div>

		<p>Beloved, God fearing Saints, Praise the Lord and God bless you this night. What a glorious, powerful and really strong Spiritual weekend we just had, as God revealed his LOVE, MERCY and tender love to us as HE revealed what just happened. In lieu of what has just gripped the hearts of the world, brought the nations to their knees, with this massive destructive disaster in Japan, WE saw scripturally, we SAW IT in the Word saint, WHY this happened and WHY this was a turning point again toward the coming of the Lord.</p>

		<p>Saints, life as WE know it, is to be spiritual, while the world knows life naturally. That is why to be naturally minded or carnally minded makes people at enmity with God. That is why when we are TRULY Born Again, we die to the world, and come alive to the Kingdom, a Kingdom NOT of THIS world. We are to be trained now to SEE spiritually and KNOW life by the Spirit and NOT the flesh, Selah. Friday night was powerful, awesome and I pray it put not only the fear of God more IN you, but I pray it scared us all in a sense where we walk now even more in sensitivity to holiness, righteousness and obedience. We talk so much about the last days saints, and NOW you know, they are here. I talk SO much in the writings about being UNDER THE BLOOD IN your homes. I share it all the time. Here it is, please ponder this:</p>

		<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 200px;">
			<p>Exodus 12:21-23 <br/>Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover. [22] And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning. [23] For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you</p>
		</div>

		<p>Saints, we are to be living holy, Godly and pure lives. Our homes are to be our sanctuaries and God's House a place of refuge. When you work during the week on your jobs, LOVE NOT that world, but realize you are there to be a light. Yet when you get off work, GET HOME saints, get to YOUR families, and when the House of God is open BE THERE, for that is our life, amen. Let not the stench or dirtiness of the world, taint you, but be cleansed always by coming OUT from it. Be not seduced by it, nor those in it. I pray with all my heart, you are ALL taking to heart more today than ever before, the Word of God in your marriages, relationships, prayer time, fastings, and living UNDER the blood in your homes. Come OUT of this world in the sense of fellowshipping with it or those in it. Be YE holy, for holy is HE who called you.</p>

		<p>Saints, PLEASE read the preceding verses in Ex.12:1-20. THEN read what I quoted above. The destroyer that God sent was NOT Satan, but God himself sending in the Angel of the Lord to smite the earth and bring death to the first born of Egypt. God said, when HE SAW the blood covering the homes of those who obeyed, the destroyer would PASSOVER them. So it was God who brought such judgment, SELAH. This is why, we showed you Rev.7 this weekend about the angels who have the POWER to hurt the earth.</p>

		<p>Friday night was an evening VERY sober and VERY intense and VERY powerful as the Holy Spirit revealed to us the reality of the Kingdom of God and last days judgments. SAINTS you must be under the blood. The Lord shared in detail Friday about this devastation, destruction, immense judgment in the earth and we saw this IN the scriptures. Let us NEVER take lightly the Word of God saints, and let us realize, JESUS IS REAL saints, and so are the judgments coming from HIM. Yet Satan is REAL also, and his unseen forces are SO powerful in this day and hour, let us NOT be deceived, blinded or seduced away from truth. Friday was a night of great magnitude.</p>

		<p>Then yesterday, I heard you Sisters had a powerful day together in Spirit and
		in Word and in prayer. Praise God sisters for your joinings, for again, YOUR life, is together as Handmaidens who prophesy. Then today, so much more was brought forth FROM the scriptures only saints to expound about the reality of the time we are in. I PRAY with ALL my heart, you all rejoice for New Covenant and being in a ministry that speaks truth and keeps you sharp in present day truth. I pray saints, YOU rejoice to know, the Kingdom of God is in your midst here and you are LIVING lives prepared for that day. I KNOW, many "Senior Pastors" today gave their 20 minute sermons on the tragic events, but I am sure MANY did not attribute it to God, HIS judgment for SIN, or anything thereof.</p>

		<p>Saints, be prepared, and remember ALL the scriptures we covered from Friday night to today. From Mt. 24, Heb. 10,11,12, I Thess. 5, Ps.9, Ps.46, Pr.27, Pr.16, Pr.19, Revelation 3,6,7 With what you learned today, give thanks to God saints. Praise HIS HOLY name this night before bed, praying and sanctifying your hearts IN the Lord. The depth of this devastation was EPIC and Biblical saints, oh YES it was. A land mass, a WHOLE nation moved 8 feet, the Earth's Crust was ruptured over 200 miles long and 100 miles wide. The Earth's Axis was changed, altered by 4 inches, which may not seem much to us, but it will bring castastrophies of greater depth in the future in nature saints. THESE are the last days. Surely these are days to be ON FIRE for God, IN HIS HOUSE, with HIS PEOPLE, AWAY from the world, the ungodly, unsavory and unsaved and unruly.</p>

		<p>Saints, the Bible is OUR bread of life, and OUR light, and OUR path and OUR way and OUR protection. God says be UNDER THE BLOOD when Judgment comes. The Destroyer's in the Bible are Angels saints, and they will release seals, and vials and judgments in Revelation. One released something of such magnitude this week, that the whole EARTH trembled, the mountains were moved from their place and the sea was stirred. The Psalms we saw today SHOWED this and the nations will feel this repercussion. NOT only naturally, but economically as well. This will touch the economies of the world, even America, and get ready saints, for America THIS YEAR in 2011, will face many trying times. We will face many judgments in our nation from massive powerful Tornadoes, to floods, to fires, to famine, to escalating food prices, to Hurricanes, to uprisings, as life gets harder and harder. BUT FEAR NOT, Praise God, as we saw today, FEAR NOT when judgment comes, for God WILL be our buckler and shield.</p>

		<p>Have a good week saints, witness, share with your bosses, co workers, but fellowship NOT with the world. I pray your prayer life this week will increase and even you husbands and wives will pray more together than ever before. Let THAT love fill your hearts. Pray with your youth and children and BE BLESSED this week, as see another week of the world crumbling. In two years we have seen Chile, Haiti, New Zealand and now Japan. More is coming. We all have a day coming, and we must obey HIS voice to KNOW HIS way. PREPARE your ark saints in the fear of God, reverencing HIM with Godly fear.</p>

		<div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 200px;">
			<p>Hebrews 12:28</br>
			Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:</p>
		</div>

		<p>God accepts us saints, when we SERVE HIM in reverence and Godly fear, Selah. God bless you all and thank you for a wonderful weekend in the House of God. It was a blessing to see you all Friday, then you sisters yesterday and all of you today. We are surely a wonderful family IN Christ. It surely was glorious and powerful in the midst of trying times. I will see you Tuesday night, Lord willing for prayer in the House of God, and then Friday night. As always, PRAY for the nations, their needs, and pray for me always saints, for I surely need and truly covet your prayers in life. Pray for my back to heal, for it has been pained now for two weeks and it has made it difficult for me to do things I need to do. I thank those of you for the meals you prepare for me at times, they mean MORE to me than you know. Brother Kim</p>
