		<h2>To the Elders in the Faith</h2>

		<br/>Praise the Lord and God bless you on this day.  We are called as &#x201c;Elders&#x201d; in the faith to stand on and represent the principles concerning the Kingdom of God.  I address this cover letter to all men that are &#x201c;called&#x201d; by our Heavenly Father to represent the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ.  We live in a day where the scriptures expressly tell us of perilous times and where doctrines of devils and seducing spirits will lead beloved saints FROM the faith once delivered unto them.  We are called as Elders to Shepherd the flock and take oversight (Bishop Ministry) which protects the soul from such deception.<br/><br/>           We must remember to not &#x201c;substitute&#x201d; views, opinions, emotions or feelings, for Paul warned us in Col.2:8 about how men would spoil the saints with traditions, vain deceits and philosophies which are after the rudiments of the world and NOT after Christ.  Jesus Christ himself warned his disciples about the leaven of Pharisees (men&#x2019;s doctrines, views and opinions) which made the Holy Word of God of none effect (Mt.15:1-10 and Mt.16:1-3)  It is therefore of the utmost reverence and fear of the living God that we as men of God should by all means speak truth and only truth, of which there is only one truth and that is the Word of God. &#x201c;Shall we now persuade men or God?  Should we please men?  If we please men then we should NOT be the servants of Jesus Christ&#x201d;. Sound like strong words?  Read Gal.1:10<br/><br/>           You have heard much, I am sure, these last few years about different aspects of the Christmas Holiday.  I would ask you all in Jesus precious name to please read this in detail and with an open heart.  Everything spoken is FACTUAL TRUTH and SPIRITUAL TRUTH.   The &#x201c;Spirit&#x201d; behind this, which you will read about as it is exposed, is one of blasphemy, lasciviousness and sexual perversion.    The question is, what will we do with it?  Jesus said in Luke 6:46, &#x201c;Why do you call me Lord, Lord, yet do not the things I say&#x201d;?  If we truly love Jesus we will keep HIS word and offer no strange fire before HIM.<br/><br/>           Now to you men of God out there who stand before the children of God as faithful shepherds and Elders, this I ask.  As  Born-Again, spirit-filled men of God, would you allow someone in your church to:  Pray the Rosary?  I pray not&#x2014;you would bring correction.  Would you allow someone to Pray to Mary, pray the dead OUT of Purgatory, pray to saints , pray to IDOLS allow someone to lift up the Pope as the vicar of Christ in the earth?  I pray not&#x2014;you would bring correction.  WHY would you then allow someone to observe Christmas?  It comes from the SAME church!!  The SAME spirit!!  The SAME roots as the Rosary, Mary worship, Purgatory, Idols.  Why would you not allow all the others but EXPLAIN away Christmas?  Think about it.  Obedience is better than sacrifice.  Do you fear men or God?  Speak truth I pray, unto the saints and set them free..  If we are called to speak and live on the Word of God, then why do we observe this thing called Christmas, when it was never recorded, observed or mentioned in the Bible?  Since when are we as men of God to bring things to our beloved brethren that are not founded or built upon the foundation of Jesus Christ who is the Word of God?  I desire to be a wise-masterbuilder (I Cor.3) and I will take heed to how I build.<br/><br/> There are no views and opinions here.  The Pharisees (Religious Elders) stood on the street corners every day beckoning people with the love of God..  These are the very ones who ended up gnashing their teeth and crucifying the Lord Jesus Christ.  In John 8:40-44, they were the ones who said their father was God in heaven, yet Jesus said their father was the devil!  Who is  our Father, I pray we know?  It was in John 6:66   (666-the number of man)   where many disciples walked with HIM no more due to HIS hard sayings.  They followed &#x201c;THEIR&#x201d; ways.  Prayerfully this is not  a hard saying for you. <br/><br/>           It is going to take loving, caring and strong men of God in this hour to build the Kingdom of God..  Where is the preaching today that turns the world upside down, causes gnashing of teeth, stoning, and being driven from cities?  That is the way the Book of Acts was recorded.  The Kingdom of God DID NOT give us Christmas, but &#x201c;Christianity&#x201d; did.  The Roman Catholic Church gave us this idolatry..   We know that John the Baptist, Jesus and the Apostles NEVER preached &#x201c;Christianity&#x201d;&#x2014;they preached the Kingdom of God.  The name &#x201c;Christian&#x201d; was not given to a believer of Jesus, but a DISCIPLE of Jesus Christ&#x2014;Acts 11.  A disciple obeys his master..  Jesus said ONE way, ONE truth, ONE life and ONE door.  Christianity alone has over 250 different dogmas and doctrines and denominations in America alone.  May we see the truth of many going one way, few and  a remnant finding the Kingdom of God.<br/><br/>           I would pray you all would honestly search your hearts after reading this.  Please do not put it down or throw it away without first reading it through.  Let not your soul man sway you because of our &#x201c;traditions&#x201d;.  Remember why the very first Doctrine of Christ was &#x201c;Repentance from DEAD WORKS&#x201d;.  May we forever be blessed, and may you have the strength to stand before the saints of God and speak truth   Remember, Prove all things.  God Bless you.  I would love to hear from you.  If you feel I error in truth, then please bring correction to me, for I am willing to repent (change my way of thinking), but remember that all correction and instruction MUST be by the Word of God. (II Tim.3:15-17)   Enjoy this teaching and please do not be offended by some of the things you will read about the sexual perversion behind this thing. <br/> <br/>A brother, friend and servant<br/> Mr. Kim C.Gossett&#x2014;Lead Elder<br/>New Covenant Christian Center Int&#x2019;l<br/>World Outreach Director<br/> <a href="mailto:SiayaLives@yahoo.com">SiayaLives@yahoo.com</a>

		<h2>To the Disciples in the Kingdom of God</h2>

		<br/> <br/>                Praise the Lord and God bless each and every one you that are Born-Again into the Kingdom of God. I would pray that what you are about to read does NOT offend your soul man, but rather pricks your heart to see, learn and desire change for His Glory. As Children of God we are called to PROVE all Things &#x2013; I Thess 5:21<br/> <br/>                The Bible tells us in Acts 11 that &#x201c;Disciples&#x201d; of Jesus Christ were called Christians. Today, all anyone has to do is be a believer in Jesus and they feel that qualifies them to be Christians. Sadly, this would make Satan a Christian (do not be offended) for Satan believes in Jesus Christ. A Disciple is one who is disciplined, dedicated and broken before the Lord of Hosts. We are called to live on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God (Mt. 4:4, Lu. 4:4). What you are about to read is factual, truthful and contains no views or opinions. I would pray that as you read this and study your Bibles, you will see that what is spoken be truth. Please go to your Bibles at all times and read the scriptures for yourself. You will be amazed at how much you have been taught to believe that is actually contrary to the Holy Word of God. For example, just ask anyone who cut Samson&#x2019;s hair and they will most likely say, Delilah. Read your Word of God and you will find out Delilah di NOT cut Samson&#x2019;s hair, but rather the Philistines. See how much we just believe because we were told that way? Did the wise men really come to a manger? Read your Bibles and find out that when they arrived, Jesus was two years old living in a house. They never came to a manger, but every Church show this lying wonder every year when there is no truth behind it. Enjoy what you are about to read.<br/> <br/>                I pray with an open and pure heart that you will take to heart, listen to the Holy Spirit and then commit to change for the purpose of obeying our Lord Jesus Christ. This book is written in the Spirit of love and mercy. It is written to expose the unfruitful works of darkness. You cannot explain away deception, nor can you continue to obey that which is false. Our soul man is very powerful and is ruled by emotions and feelings. For this cause we just &#x201c;die to self&#x201d; and allow the Spirit of God to transform us.<br/> <br/>                I would also pray for those of you who read this that you would understand that this book is NOT for everyone. It is written for the remnant and faithful saints that are willing to recognize truth and be willing to be persecuted by taking a stance. Remember, it was those who said their Father in Heaven was God that Jesus said were of their father the devil &#x2013; Jn. 8:40-44. Who were these false teachers and false preachers?  They were the Pharisees and Sadducee&#x2019;s, religious men. The very men who turned over the Son of Man and had him crucified, said their father was God in Heaven. May we always remember that in the Kingdom of God NO man will be exalted, only the Lord Jesus Christ. May we remember that the students in Berea &#x2013; Acts 17, were found to be more noble in the sight of God. Why? Because their hearts were pure to listen to the at which was preached, but they SEARCHED the scriptures daily to see if these things were so. THEN they believed.<br/> <br/>                To the faithful brethren, born of the Spirit of God. Search YE the Scriptures and build your life off of what the Spirit of God teaches you and NOT men. I would rather stand with the 120 at Pentecost (the remnant) then to stand with the 5,000 in the multitude. Do not be persuaded by what men preach or teach. Be persuaded by what the Word of God says. We are warned in Col. 2:8 to beware of being spoiled by men. Many preachers today say it is okay to observe traditions like Christmas. After reading this book, why not let you spirit in line with the Holy Spirit be the judge of that. I condemn no man or woman who observes this pagan and heathen ritual. I will speak truth though and ask how can one who truly is Born-Again continue to observe this one they are enlightened to truth? Be not shocked nor condemned, but rather be set free by that which you will learn. Ask the Lord to help you and remember the greatest persecution will come from those who call themselves your friends. Take a hard and deep look at this teaching. Be blessed and ask yourself why &#x201c;Christmas&#x201d; was never mentioned in the Bible, yet EVERTHING done at Christmas is warned against and spoken against in the Bible. That in itself should tell you something.<br/> <br/>                My deepest prayer is for true disciples to be set free from  this, heave their eyes enlightened and their preaching more anointed. I believe for the truth in heart this will be a tremendous blessing. It will also cause some to gnash their teeth and speak evil of that which you will now come to learn. May the Lord richly bless you.

</TABLE>Praise the Lord and God bless each and every one of you about
to read this factual and truthful teaching.&nbsp; My prayer for each
of you is that you will pray first and then with an open heart and
spirit study EVERY scripture quoted and allow your spirit to show you
factual truth.&nbsp; Please submit your heart to the Word of God and
with all seriousness and reverence, enter into this with the Holy
fear of God.&nbsp; Do not let the hardness of your heart provoke you
nor your emotions and feelings rule you.&nbsp; Hearken to the Spirit
of God and let TRUTH be TRUTH.&nbsp; Please take the time to read the
whole teaching.&nbsp; Do not start and then put it aside because of
disbelief.&nbsp; Please read it all.
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Jesus said in Luke 4:4 and in Mt.4:4, “Man
shall not live on bread alone, but BY EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF
THE MOUTH OF GOD.”&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus said in John 8:31-32, “IF
you CONTINUE in my word, are you my disciples indeed; and ye shall
know the TRUTH and the TRUTH shall make you free.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jesus said in John 14:15, “If you love me, keep my commandments,
and in verse 23, if a man love me, he will keep MY words.&quot;&nbsp;
Jesus also said in John 16:13-15, “Howbeit when HE, the Spirit of
truth is come, HE will guide you into ALL TRUTH: for HE shall not
speak of Himself; but whatsoever HE shall hear, shall HE speak: and
HE will SHEW you things to come.&nbsp; HE shall glorify me; for HE
shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.&nbsp; ALL things
that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that HE shall take
of mine and shall shew it unto you.&quot;&nbsp; The Holy Spirit will
only glorify the “THE WORD OF GOD.&quot; These are very profound
words, yet they MUST be the basis that we as Born-Again believers
live on.&nbsp; No other foundation can be laid, but that which is
laid—which is Jesus Christ—I Cor.3:11.&nbsp; The Apostle Peter
told us in I Peter 1:23 that we are Born-Again by the Word of God,
and that it was and is incorruptible seed.&nbsp; We must remember
that the Word became flesh—John 1:14, and we named the Word—Jesus.&nbsp;
By this we can now see and understand why so much emphasis is put on
the Word, and why Jesus said that everything of TRUTH would be shown
to us by the Holy Spirit and that we should “obey” all of HIS
word.&nbsp; One other very important scripture that we must note is
what was stated by Jesus in Matthew 15:3, <U>“</U><U><B>Why do you
also transgress the commandment of God by YOUR TRADITIONS</B></U>?&quot;&nbsp;
In verse 6 Jesus said that the traditions of men make the Word of God
of NONE EFFECT!!&nbsp; Can you imagine our traditions making the Holy
Word of God of none effect?&nbsp; What Jesus was saying is that when
we as men make a tradition of something and TRY to make it
“Spiritual,&quot; then it will make the Word of God of none effect
and end up being a Strange fire before our Father in Heaven.&nbsp; If
we do anything at all for him, it should be recorded in the Word of
God so we can have divine instruction from our Father on how to do it
right.&nbsp; Every time a Holy Feast or a Holy Day was ever observed
by God’s people, HE ALWAYS gave instruction on HOW to do it.&nbsp;
Notice how through our natural, carnal ways, we have taken HOLY DAY
and made it HOLI-DAY.&nbsp; The Word of God was not given to man to
have him do with it as he pleased, but to learn it and live it that
we would be obedient to the one who saved us from a life of sin and
darkness. &nbsp;It was not “In the beginning—man, but God!!&nbsp;
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">We have pretty much swallowed up the divine
truth of God by observing OUR traditions and what we think pleases
HIM,&nbsp; instead of obeying HIS truth and doing what HE says
pleases Him.&nbsp; Have you ever wondered why we were never told the
birth date of Jesus?&nbsp; Have you ever given thought as to why
“Christmas” is NEVER mentioned in the Bible?&nbsp; Have you ever
thought why the Early Church believers and spiritual fathers NEVER
taught, NEVER observed and NEVER celebrated Jesus’ birth, but
rather the resurrection?&nbsp; We are about to journey into an area
that for some will seem unbelievable, others may say, well we have
always done it this way, so we will continue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Others may
say,&nbsp; “My Lord, why have I never been taught this before?&quot;&nbsp;
ONLY FACT AND TRUTH SHALL YOU NOW SEE AND HEAR.&nbsp; May your spirit
man be blessed!!</P>

</TABLE>As Born-Again believers we are commanded in the Word of God
to live accordingly to HIS statutes, commandments and ordinances.&nbsp;
We are called by Paul in Ephesians 5:6-11 (please read fully) to not
be DECEIVED by the vain words of man, and that having once walked in
darkness ourselves, we are now to manifest the light (The Word) and
expose the unfruitful works of darkness.&nbsp; Now please remember
that Jesus said in Matthew 7:15-20 (please read fully) that a good
tree can not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree can not bear good fruit.&nbsp;
Now do you think that what he said he meant?&nbsp; Of course he
did!!&nbsp; He also said in verse 15 that False Prophets would come
in sheeps clothing, meaning they have an outward appearance of being
good, but inside they are ravening wolves.&nbsp; If you will read
this slowly and meditate upon it, I believe you will see that
Christmas is such.&nbsp; Outward it has all the appearance of being
good, yet what lies inside is its root and its root is evil and this
we shall now begin to see.&nbsp; Now, I ask you again to please
remember only the WORD OF GOD in dealing with this issue.&nbsp; NOT
your emotions!!&nbsp; NOT your feelings!!&nbsp; NOT what you think!!&nbsp;
Remember the Holy Word of God!!&nbsp; Again Paul said in Eph.5, do
not be “DECEIVED” by the vain words of men.&nbsp;&nbsp; My
friend, it is better for us to hearken to and&nbsp; obey the Word of
God than to sacrifice—I Sam. 15:22.&nbsp; There will be many so
called men of God, Pastors and Teachers that will condemn this
teaching, yet they will only violate the Holy Word of God by doing
so.&nbsp; Please take a stand on the factual truth of the Word of
God.&nbsp; Who cares what men say.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would rather follow
the Lord Jesus, than the multitudes of people with all their views
and opinions.<U> </U><U><B>Christianity says, “We can do it our
way” but the Kingdom of God says,&nbsp; “We will do it HIS way.&quot;</B></U>&nbsp;
A tree is known by its fruit Jesus said.&nbsp; A good tree can not
bear bad, and a bad can not bear good.&nbsp; A tree is known by its
ROOTS.&nbsp; Bad roots, bad tree; good roots, good tree.&nbsp; We are
called trees of righteousness in the Bible, for now our roots are in
the Word of God, thus our fruit becomes good fruit.&nbsp; John the
Baptist said in Matthew 3:10 (speaking of Jesus), “And now also the
axe is laid unto the ROOT of the trees: therefore every tree which
bringeth NOT forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire”.&nbsp;
Now this is being directed towards the men of religious teaching—the
Pharisees and Sadducees in verse 7, of whom Jesus warned us (his
disciples) to take heed to their doctrine or teaching—Matthew
16:1-13.&nbsp; These were also the men who said their Father was God
in Heaven, yet Jesus said they were of their father the devil—John
8:40-44. <U>&nbsp;</U><U><B>The point I desire to make as we go into
this teaching is this.&nbsp; Please do not be swayed, persuaded or
convinced something is true because of what the masses believe or
what other men preach and teach and say, but be convinced something
is true because its foundation is built OUT OF the Word of God</B></U>.&nbsp;
Many of us do things today out of pure ignorance.&nbsp; But once we
know the truth, we are called to follow after it.&nbsp; The Word of
God is the axe!!&nbsp; If we are always being warned in the Bible to
not be DECEIVED, then the only way is to lay the axe to the root of
everything we hear and see. This way we are protected to come to know
only that which is spoken of God.&nbsp; The root is always the place
of origin and beginnings, including true or false doctrine.&nbsp; We
are commanded&nbsp; by God himself to go and PROVE ALL THINGS—I
Thess.5:21.&nbsp; We are called by God, to TRY THE SPIRITS—I
Jn.4:1-5.&nbsp; So let us begin to prove “CHRISTMAS.&quot;&nbsp; If
Christmas is not found in the Bible—the truth that frames the
worlds—then where did it come from?&nbsp; Where did it originate?&nbsp;
Is Christmas REALLY celebrating Jesus’ birthday?&nbsp; Did the
orginal Apostles—our spiritual fathers and foundation in the faith
and those who knew Jesus personally, EVER teach or celebrate HIS
birthday?&nbsp; Was Jesus born on December 25<SUP>th</SUP>?&nbsp; If
Christmas is the greatest of Christian Holidays, then why do so many
heathens who damn him daily and take our Fathers name in vain,
celebrate it?&nbsp; Most people suppose a lot about Christmas being
so true, yet have any ever searched it out to see where its roots
lie?&nbsp; Let us now learn the truth.&nbsp; May you all be blessed
with open heart and spirit.&nbsp; Our Heavenly Father, our Lord Jesus
Christ and the precious Holy Spirit have absolutely NOTHING to do
with Christmas. My question is this.&nbsp; Should We??

</TABLE><U><B>If Christmas was NEVER found in the Bible, NEVER
observed in the Bible and NEVER acknowledged, then where did it come
from?&nbsp; Always remember this; if something is NOT found in the
Holy Word of God, then it comes NOT from God</B></U>.&nbsp; In Rome,
over 300 years AFTER the resurrection of our Lord, there was a yearly
feast celebrated by the Romans who worshipped the god Saturn.&nbsp;
This time of celebration was always situated around the December
17<SUP>th</SUP>--24<SUP>th</SUP> time frame so it would coincide with
the ending of the winter solstice, a time for seasonal pagan worship.
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="text-decoration: none">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U><B>THE PAGAN&nbsp; YEAR</B></U>:&nbsp; This
is always a period of days, months and times that revolve around the
seasonal changes of the earth and are usually in the winter, spring,
summer and fall.&nbsp; The WINTER SOLSTICE is a day or period of days
in the winter when the days are shortest (light) and the nights
longest (darkness prevails).&nbsp; This is usually a time in their
festivities of drunkenness, revelry and debauchery (perversion), and
I must say, that spirit is no different in the world we live today.&nbsp;
The Pagan Romans called this celebration<U> “</U><U><B>THE FEAST OF
SATURNALIA,&quot;</B></U> in honor of their god Saturn.&nbsp; They
celebrated the festival from the 17<SUP>th</SUP> to the 24<SUP>th</SUP>
of December, usually exchanging “gifts” on the last two days from
house to house.&nbsp; Then on the 25<SUP>th</SUP> of December, they
began the new Celebration of “The birth of the unconquerable Sun,&quot;
as the days of light would now begin to lengthen and the sun would
now begin to regain its dominance.&nbsp; During this time, the
ancient pagans believed that the sun would die during the winter
solstice and then RISE AGAIN from death as the solstice ended by the
revolving of the earth in nature.&nbsp; Does this begin to sound a
little familiar to the “SON” who died and rose again?&nbsp; Thus,
every year these people would have their celebrations to serve their
gods, of which we as Born-Again believers now know, and we</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">know that Satan is the one behind them all.&nbsp;
When the Roman Catholic Church had now been born in Rome, they saw
that during this time, there was no party or celebration for their
Christian faith or their God. Since the 25<SUP>th</SUP> of December
was the day when the gifts were given for the</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">beginning of the Sun-god to rise again, they
chose to take this pagan ritual and worship the Son of God.&nbsp;
Since the heathen had the 25<SUP>th</SUP> of December as the day of
the sun-god birthday, the Roman Catholic Church chose to have their
Son-God Birthday.&nbsp; When the church saw the festival</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">the pagans had with their god, they now realized
there was nothing for their own belief.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of
rebuking, correcting and taking a stand on holiness and
righteousness, they <U>“</U><U><B>INCORPORATED</B></U>” the pagan
ideologies into their Christianity.&nbsp;&nbsp; All Satan did was
disguise a church in the name of our Lord and open the floodgates of
paganism and heathenism to pollute truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How
sad!!&nbsp; Do you think the Apostle Paul would have ever compromised
like this?&nbsp; Hardly!!&nbsp; Just read the Book of Acts and see
how he stood out and condemned pagan rituals.&nbsp; But then again,
we must remember where the Catholic Church came from.&nbsp; Even
Jesus said in Revelation 2:13 that there would be a church where
Satan’s seat would be yet it would keep the name of Jesus and men
would be martyred. &nbsp;Just study history of the inquisition and
see how many millions were killed at the hands of the Popes and
Catholicism as heretics for taking a stand on the Word of God. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Now to you men of God out there who stand before
the children of God as faithful shepherds and Elders, this I ask.&nbsp;
As a Born-Again, spirit-filled man of God, would you allow someone in
your church to: <U>&nbsp;</U><U><B>Pray the Rosary</B></U>?&nbsp; I
pray not—you would bring correction.&nbsp; Would you allow someone

Would you allow someone to<U> </U><U><B>lift up the Pope</B></U> as

Christmas?&nbsp; It comes from the SAME church!!&nbsp; The SAME
spirit!!&nbsp; The SAME roots as the Rosary, Mary worship, Purgatory,
Idols.&nbsp; Why would you not allow all the others but EXPLAIN away
Christmas?&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; Obedience is better than
sacrifice.&nbsp; Do you fear men or God?&nbsp; Speak truth I pray,
unto the saints and set them free.&nbsp;&nbsp; No more need&nbsp; be
said on Catholicism at this time. Just know if you know the truth
about that religion, you can now begin to see where Christmas came
from and why it was NEVER in the Bible. Let us go on.&nbsp; Now in
competition with the pagan's holiday and the heathen superstition,
the Catholic church started having a “MASS” for “CHRIST,&quot;
which is now today’s CHRIST—MASS or Christmas. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;Now, if any of you reading this were
raised Catholic, and you are now Born-Again, then you MUST know that
there is a very great difference in your life now that you are saved
by the blood and filled with the Spirit of truth!!&nbsp; After you
become Born-Again, do you still worship the mass?&nbsp; Do you still
pray to Mary?&nbsp; Do you still pray the rosary?&nbsp; Do you still
pray to saints? Do you still believe in purgatory?&nbsp; Of course
NOT!!&nbsp; You have been set free.&nbsp; But&nbsp; now I ask this.&nbsp;
Since Christmas is an origin of the Catholic church with all its
pagan rituals incorporated, then why would we want to celebrate it?&nbsp;
Remember the roots of the trees.&nbsp; Bad roots, bad tree.&nbsp; We
have a very bad tree here, and think about it.&nbsp; What does every
home have in it at Christmas time?&nbsp; A TREE!!&nbsp; If you will
take the time to research the “Encyclopedia Britannica”,
“Encyclopedia Americana”or the “World Book Encyclopedia”, you
will see each and every one of them give the historical beginning of
Christmas.&nbsp; Let us first read from the World Book Encyclopedia
about this god Saturn, Saturnalia and the history of Christmas
origins.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P>“SATURN was the youngest son of Uranus (heaven) and Gaea(earth)
in Roman</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;Mythology.&nbsp; The name probably comes
from the Latin verb “serere” which means“to sow”.&nbsp; The
Greeks called him Kronos (where we get time-chronology-from)&nbsp;
and to the Romans, Saturn was the god of HARVEST. (Sound Familiar?)&nbsp;
The&nbsp;festival called SATURNALIA was held in Rome every year from
December 17<SUP>th&nbsp; &nbsp;to the 23rd in his honor.&nbsp; During
Saturnalia, the Golden Age was supposedly returned&nbsp;to the
earth.&nbsp; The Greek word “chronos” means time. Kronos or
Saturn is usually&nbsp;depicted as a bent old man&nbsp; with the
scythe (sickle) in the one hand.&nbsp; In the other hand,&nbsp;he
holds a serpent which bites its own tail.&nbsp; The story of Saturn’s
swallowing his own children is a way of showing that time creates and
then it destroys its creations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>This is quite powerful, is it not?&nbsp; Look at this spiritually
through the eyes of truth.&nbsp; This god, represented to them a god
of time and a god of harvest.&nbsp; Does not the Bible say that no
man will know the TIME of the HARVEST?&nbsp; Does not the Bible say
the reapers (Angels) will come and put in the sickle for
harvest?--Mark 4:29&nbsp; Notice how in one hand is the sickle,
representing harvest and in the other hand a serpent, thus Satan
actually believes he can harvest the world, in his time, and this is
what the people were celebrating each year—the god Saturn.&nbsp;
Also it says that Saturn would devour his own children.&nbsp; Just
like those of the World will end up devoured in hell.&nbsp; Satan is
a master of deception and Satan is the SPIRIT behind Christmas.&nbsp;
Do you honestly think we can put</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">the name Jesus on this pagan wickedness and
expect our Heavenly Father to be pleased?&nbsp; So much for our
saying that Jesus is the reason for the season.&nbsp; What a lie this
truly is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Satan is the reason for this season.&nbsp; As
for me and my house, we will serve the Lord and put this wickedness
far away.&nbsp; We are not close to being done, so please keep your
soul at peace and continue to read the rest of this teaching as we
expose the unfruitful works of darkness.</P>
<P><U>“</U><U><B>SATURNALIA”</B></U>—was the name of an ancient
Roman festival given in honor of Saturn, the Roman harvest god. (My
emphasis here, but notice how close the name and sound of SATAN and
SATURN). The festival began on Dec.17<SUP>th </SUP>and lasted for
seven days.&nbsp; On the first day, public religious ceremonies
honoring Saturn took place.&nbsp; On the second day, many families
offered sacrifices of young pigs. The SATURNALIA&nbsp; festival was a
gay occasion.&nbsp; Schools closed and all public&nbsp; business
stopped.&nbsp; Courts of law closed their doors, and no criminals
could be punished.&nbsp; Families held their banquets and even slaves
were free to attend&nbsp; the festival.&nbsp; The last days of the
festival were spent visiting and EXCHANGING&nbsp; presents.&nbsp;
Some of the gifts were little clay images called “sigillaria”,
which means small images (idols)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After reading this account, you can see, or least I should say you
SHOULD see that everything that these pagan people did to worship
their god of harvest, is identical to what people do today for
Christmas—and of course—why not?&nbsp; This is where it all came
from—Satan!!&nbsp; Notice how the exchanging of gifts to each other
were the little graven images or idols.&nbsp; I pray you can see the
picture coming together of this total blasphemy to the Kingdom of
God.&nbsp; Let us go on now and see the history of Christmas and
please remember—THE AXE IS TO BE LAID TO THE ROOT OF</P>
<P>THE TREE!!!!</P>
<P><U>“<B>THE HISTORY OF CHRISTMAS”</B></U></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Scholars do not know the exact date of Christ’s
birth.&nbsp; For more than 300 years, people observed HIS birthday on
various dates.&nbsp; In the yearA.D.354, Bishop Liberius of Rome
“ORDERED” the people to celebrate on December 25<SUP>th</SUP>.&nbsp;
He probably chose this date because the people of Rome already
observed it as the Feast of Saturn, celebrating the birth of the
sun.&nbsp; Christians honored Christ, instead of Saturn, as the light
of the World.&nbsp; For many years, people observed Christmas as a
religious festival only.&nbsp;&nbsp; They gradually adopted more and
more customs <U>“</U><U><B>UNRELATED</B></U>” to the church.&nbsp;
In England, during the Middle Ages, Christmas became the “merriest”
day of the year.&nbsp; Celebrations eventually became so rowdy that
the <U><B>Puritans in England DID AWAY</B></U> with the observance of
Christmas by law in 1643.&nbsp; Colonists in New England copied the
English laws known as the Blue Laws.&nbsp; But eventually, immigrants
brought with them Christmas customs from many lands.&nbsp; Christmas
today affects most industries because of the millions of persons who
buy products of all kinds as gifts.&nbsp; Manufacturers often begin
planning the next years' sales as soon as the holidays are over.&nbsp;
In most “department stores”, children can tell SANTA CLAUS what
they want for Christmas.&nbsp; They wait in long lines to climb the
sparkling “throne” where Santa sits in his red and white suit.&nbsp;
The whole area looks like fairyland, with huge colorful displays of
the latest toys.&nbsp; Merchants sell more of almost every kind of
product during Christmas season than at any other time of year”.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World
Book Encyclopedia</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">How grievous and sad that the people of natural
knowledge in the World know more about the truth of this holiday than
those who profess to be children of God.&nbsp; How sad, in that we
are to be the ones taking a stand on the Holy Scriptures.&nbsp; Yet
we are just as blinded by the god of this world.&nbsp; Once again,
let us look at a few things through the SPIRITUAL EYES.&nbsp; We will
deal more in detail with Santa Claus later.&nbsp; First we now know
why the celebrating of Christmas was NEVER mentioned in the Bible. It
has no root in the Holiness of the Kingdom of God.&nbsp; It may be an
issue with Christianity, but that in itself today is a vast array of
different organizations, denominations and doctrines of men.&nbsp;
The Kingdom of God is orderly, perfect and has but ONE DOOR, ONE WAY,
ONE TRUTH and ONE LIFE.&nbsp; We now at least know where the roots
lie of this pagan ritual.&nbsp; And remember again, how can we as
Born-Again believers take something from SATAN and dedicate it to our
Lord Jesus Christ?&nbsp; It is strange fire!!&nbsp; These are NOT my
views and opinions either.&nbsp; I am standing purely on the Word of
God.&nbsp; The roots of this origin come right out of the World
system of Babylon!!--Listen to this!</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U>“</U><U><B>Alas, alas, that great city
BABYLON, that mighty city!</B></U><U> </U><U><B>For in one hour is
thy judgment come.&nbsp; And the MERCHANTS of the earth shall weep

<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P CLASS="msonormal">Will you continue to buy from the merchants of
Babylon?&nbsp; Will you continue to say, no big deal, God has mercy?&nbsp;
The early fathers of this nation, the Puritans who fled from Roman
Catholic Doctrine, came from England and OUTLAWED this observance!!&nbsp;
I think you can see why by now.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">It has only been over the past 100 years now
that this holiday has begun to be observed again in America.&nbsp; We
have now only partially exposed the foundation of this order.&nbsp;
When we get into all the things associated with Christmas, I pray you
will be as appalled as I was when the Holy Spirit taught me the
truth.&nbsp; If Christ—Mass came from a mass for Christ, then just
that fact alone should cause alarm, for the Catholic Mass is one of
demonic deprivation and truly blasphemes and transgresses the Blood
at Calvary’s Cross.&nbsp; Can you honestly say you want to observe
something whose foundation and origins and roots stem from
blaspheming the Blood of Jesus Christ?</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<U>“</U><U><B>TODAYS TRADITIONS”</B></U></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">When Jesus said in John 14:6, “ I am the way,
the truth and the life”, He meant just that.&nbsp; There is NO
TRUTH outside of the Word of God, and that is why we are admonished
over and over again by the Lord himself and our Heavenly Father, to
PROVE ALL THINGS—I Thess.5:21. In this way, we can assure ourselves
of fact, truth and protection from deception. Even in Acts 17:11, the
brethren in Berea were called more noble (well born, higher in rank)
than those at Thessalonica, for they received the Word of God spoken
by Paul and Silas with all readiness of mind.&nbsp; But what did they
do to be commended by God this way?&nbsp; It says that they went and
SEARCHED THE SCRIPTURES&nbsp; to see if these things were so and THEN
they believed.&nbsp; The word searched in the Greek means to
literally SCRUTINIZE!!&nbsp; Should not we do the same today as
“Disciples” of Jesus Christ?&nbsp; God wants us to try things
spoken and witnessed, so that we can prove them by the one and only
true test<U>—</U><U><B>DOES IT LINE UP WITH THE WORD OF GOD</B></U>?&nbsp;
Not our emotions!! Not our feelings!! Not what we think!!&nbsp; NOT
WHAT MEN, MEN, MEN SAY!!&nbsp; Not what the multitudes believe or
do!! But what saith the scriptures?!!!&nbsp; We already know that the
Lord is not interested in our traditions when we try to apply them to
spiritual matters.&nbsp; Jesus again said in Matthew 15 that our
“TRADITIONS” transgress the Word of God.&nbsp; Did you get that
in your spirit?&nbsp; How sad, that we as professing Born-Again
children of God, go and make the Word of God of none effect.&nbsp;
They transgress the Word of God and make it of NONE EFFECT.&nbsp; How
can this be?&nbsp; By not observing the Word of God and proving all
things.&nbsp; The sons of Aaron—Nadab and Abihu, were slain in the
temple for offering up “STRANGE FIRE” before the Holy Lord
God—Nu.3:4 &amp; 26:61.&nbsp; Strange fire is offering something to
God that HE has not asked for, does not receive, does not observe and
truly becomes DEAD WORKS.&nbsp; Any wonder why the very first, I
repeat, the very FIRST Doctrine of Christ is Repentance from Dead
Works?&nbsp; Learn the Oracles of God my brethren and then you will
spiritually mature the Bible says and then you will see issues like
this totally in the eyes of God. Please note (I Peter 4:10-11 and
Hebrew 5:8--6:2 KJV).<U> </U>
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U><B>Let us now observe some of our traditional
thinking here. Man says it is the observance of the Lord’s
Birthday</B></U>.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U><B>Lie #1</B></U>,&nbsp; for the scriptures
(by which we are Born-Again and saved) clearly indicate no such
thing.&nbsp; In December it is the winter season, rainy and cold and
the shepherds do NOT keep their flocks out at night grazing in the
winter—Luke 2:8.&nbsp; It was customary for the shepherds to herd
their flocks and take them in after Mid-October and release them in
early spring.&nbsp; Thus the Luke 2 account of the birth of Jesus
could not have been in December.&nbsp; FACT—no man knows when Jesus
was born.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U>&nbsp;</U><U><B>Lie #2</B></U>--there is NO
RECORD in the Bible ever recorded, taught, or preached about
people&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; observing or worshipping Jesus<U>
</U><U><B>because of his birth</B></U>.&nbsp; Now please do not jump
to soulish conclusions here.&nbsp; Listen carefully!!&nbsp; You say,
but did not the Angels and Shepherd boys come and worship HIM?&nbsp;
No, they did not.&nbsp; If you will read your Bible in Luke 2:13-20,
you will see that when the Angels announced this to the
shepherds—They (the Angels)&nbsp; glorified “GOD IN THE HIGHEST”
in other words—the Heavenly Father, and when the Shepherds went to
Bethlehem, they returned the Bible says, “GLORIFYING AND PRAISING
GOD”, for what they had seen.&nbsp; Never in the earthly ministry
of our Lord Jesus, did HE ever glorify himself.&nbsp; In fact, when
the rich young ruler came asking him about salvation and saying,
“Good master, what must I do to be saved”, Jesus first responded
by saying, “why callest me good?&nbsp; There is one that is
good—God.”&nbsp; This is found in Matthew 19:17.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U><B>Lie #3</B></U>--But did not the three wise
men come and worship Jesus in the manger?&nbsp; And did not the three
wise men give gifts to HIM when he was born?&nbsp; FACT—There is
not one record of there being three wise men!&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bible
says in Matthew 2:1, there came wise men from the east.&nbsp; Verse 3
says that Herod and ALL Jerusalem were troubled and believe me my
brethren, I do not think that three men on camels would turn one eye
in Jerusalem, for the city of great size was daily filled with them.&nbsp;
Wise men usually traveled in caravans of 40 or more in number and
THIS would possibly cause a stir in the city, do you not think so?&nbsp;
The fact is that they brought three gifts—gold, frankincense and
myrrh. (Gold for his “diety”, Frankincense for the sweet aroma of
his brokenness and sacrifice and myrrh for the bitterness of his
death). Thus man’s interjection again of changing the Bible says,
there were three men.&nbsp; Did they bring these gifts to the
manger?&nbsp; You see the depiction in every Bible story, every city
park, every church altar.&nbsp; Sad to say, we again do NOT know the
truth!!&nbsp; The Bible clearly states and records in scripture in
Matthew 2:7-16, that the wise men followed the star for two years and
that is why the Bible says they presented the gifts to Jesus in HIS
HOUSE as a young child.&nbsp; Jesus was two years old when the men
finally arrived.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U>&nbsp;</U><U><B>Lie #4</B></U>--The wise men
came to worship the child.&nbsp; FACT—the scriptures say that as
“WISE MEN” they came to worship the KING of the Jews as stated in
Matthew 2:2 and isn’t it interesting to note that in verse 8, Herod
said that he wanted to worship “THE CHILD”.&nbsp; The Bible says
that WISE MEN will worship the KING, but men will worship the
child!!!&nbsp; This is why Satan has so deceived people in this
area.&nbsp; Satan wants the eyes of people on a baby and our Father
wants our eyes on the resurrected Lord and King of a Kingdom with
power and authority!!&nbsp; Have you ever asked yourself again this
question?&nbsp; <U>&nbsp;</U><U><B>From Acts 2, Pentacost, when men
were filled with the Spirit of truth and Born-Again, until the end of
the Bible,&nbsp; you will never read anywhere recorded in the
Epistles or letters to worship HIS birth, birthday or Christmas</B></U>.&nbsp;
It is NEVER recorded!&nbsp; ONLY to know HIM through the power of the
resurrection as the King of a Kingdom!!&nbsp; So why do we do it?&nbsp;
For one, no one studies their Bibles.&nbsp; No one studies the Holy
Word of God to see what is truth.&nbsp; They just take things that
men teach them and grow up learning lies and false doctrine, then
they crucify those like us who speak truth.&nbsp; Is not that what
the Pharisees, the religious men who said their father was God in
Heaven did?&nbsp; They crucified the Son of God all in the name of
God.&nbsp; This is deception my brethren and we must open our eyes.&nbsp;
People today just believe lie after lie.&nbsp; Secondly, Satan wants
the emotions of a people on a little innocent child, and not on the
resurrected lamb of glory with power and authority—The KING OF
KINGS.

<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U><B>Lie #5</B></U>—(Please meditate on this
one)&nbsp; Since there was no room in the Inn, they had to go and
find a stable or manger with animals and straw and hay and a cradle
to put Jesus in.&nbsp; FACT—there is once again no reference to
this at all. First, this was Joseph’s home town.&nbsp; Do you not
think that relatives lived there?&nbsp; Secondly, Luke 2:6-20 states
that, “And so it was, that,<U> </U><U><B>WHILE they were there in
Bethlehem</B></U>, the days were accomplished that she should be
delivered”—Luke 2:6.&nbsp; Now listen carefully.&nbsp; Do you not
think that Joseph and Mary knew she was with child and due soon?&nbsp;
They did not just show up in Bethlehem, go to an Inn, find no room
and go to a dirty, animal shelter, where there was “unclean straw”
(if you know what I mean) and have a baby.&nbsp; The Bible clearly
states that they had been there awhile and when the time was
accomplished, or fulfilled, she gave birth to her firstborn son, <U><B>THEN</B></U>
she wrapped him in swaddling clothes and<U> </U><U><B>THEN</B></U>
she laid him in a manger, for there was no room for them<U> </U><U><B>IN</B></U>
the Inn. Notice, NOT AT an Inn, but<U> </U><U><B>IN</B></U> THE Inn&nbsp;
The no room for them in the Inn, was why she laid him in a manger.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now in the days of Jesus, when a family was poor, the manger was a
PART of their house where the families lived and it was the lower
part or portion of the house which would represent his humbleness or
humility when born into this earth.&nbsp; This manger was usually
adjacent to the living quarters of the family and they would keep
their domesticated animals there.&nbsp; The manger or trough was
usually hewn out of rock,&nbsp; <U>“</U><U><B>Bakers Encyclopedia
of the Bible—Vol.2 page 1392</B></U>”

<P CLASS="msonormal">“And she brought forth her firstborn son, and

We will fill the air with lies, deception and soulish emotions all
fixated on something that has no truth in it.&nbsp; We have this
fixed and clear picture in our minds of what <U><B>&quot;there was no
room in the inn</B></U>&quot; may have meant.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we
listen to the Greek text of Luke 2:7, we may see a different scenario
for Jesus' birth.&nbsp; After all, is not our whole source of truth
to be THE BIBLE and not the leaven, doctrines, dogma and teachings of
men?&nbsp; Are we not called to be students of the Word of God like
those in Berea in Acts 17?&nbsp; Let us look to the Spirit of truth..</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">The word &quot;inn&quot; in Luke 2:7 [kataluma],

[12] And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make
ready. [13] And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and
they made ready the passover. Luke 22:12-13&nbsp; Now please
understand.&nbsp; The guestchamber was the upper room of a house for
guests.&nbsp; At the time that the Lord Jesus was to be brought
forth, this guestchamber, upstairs, was full, most likely with all of
the family relatives.&nbsp; With NO ROOM IN THE INN, Mary had to go
down to the “manger” in the lower part of the house and it was
here that she put her child who was wrapped in swaddling clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A manger usually hewn out of rock would truly be scripturally based,
for our Lord Jesus is the ROCK of our salvation and we are to build

intention&nbsp; to stay with his family. Since many out-of-town
family members would have been arriving at the same time, the guest
room [kataluma], upstairs on the roof of the house, was already
full.&nbsp; Mary and Joseph found space in the area that comprised
the first floor of the house—the manger.&nbsp; Here it&nbsp; was
usually warm and would have been comfortable for the birthing.&nbsp;
And even though used for domesticated animals and shelter, it would
have been clean.&nbsp; My friends, our Father in Heaven is an orderly
and decent Father.&nbsp; If Mary had to wait until AFTER her
purification to bring Jesus into the temple to present him to the
Father—Luke 2:22, then what makes you think that HE would allow her
to give birth in an unclean, dirty, filthy, straw dunged stable?&nbsp;
Our Father does NOT break order!! Once again, our modern day “Manger
Scene” with animals, hay and straw,&nbsp; three wise men, Joseph,
Mary, shepherds and a star over a stable all come from St. Francis of
Assisi—A Catholic Monk.&nbsp; Let us all again give thanks to the
Catholic church for allowing this lie to enter in. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Perhaps &quot;no room in the inn&quot; was not
really a rejection of&nbsp; Jesus Christ&nbsp; but a gracious
accommodation in the best circumstances the family could provide. How
interesting, also, that in Luke's gospel, while there was &quot;no
room in the kataluma&quot; for Jesus on his first night on earth,
that is exactly where he spent his last night on earth with his
disciples before going to Gethsemane to shed blood for our sin and
then to Calvary to shed blood for our sins.&nbsp; He came into the
earth lowly and humbled and finished his work high and exalted!!&nbsp;
Hallelujah!!&nbsp; The birthing of a baby was done in all cleanness
when possible, and to take a newborn baby and lay him in straw or hay
would be extremely dangerous, for the cut straw or hay could get into
the face, eyes or body and it was very sharp.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today’s
depiction is this:&nbsp; An animal stall, hay or straw, animals,
Joseph, Mary, baby Jesus in a straw laden crib, Three wise men bowing
down and giving gifts with a star hanging over.&nbsp; The truth?&nbsp;
NONE OF IT.&nbsp; Amazing isn’t it?&nbsp; Can you believe what we
depict and believe as truth because of what men say?&nbsp; Did not
Jesus warn his disciples in Matthew 16 about the leaven or teachings
of men and the Pharisees?&nbsp; Now can you see why we are called to
PROVE ALL THINGS?&nbsp; Believe me, if my baby was being born, there
would be no animals or soiled straw present.&nbsp; Well, now that HE
is born, we do not know the date, and we have shown you the manger
scene and all surrounding&nbsp; untruths. Is your foundation of
Christmas beginning to sound confusing?&nbsp; It is because truth is
setting you free (prayerfully)&nbsp; and on a straight course.&nbsp;
Sometimes our souls do not like being weaned from the doctrines of
men,&nbsp; especially when we have believed something for so long.&nbsp;
The question now is what will you men of God do about this?&nbsp;
Still set up the pageantry of lies? At least the truth is being
spoken and we can now rejoice. As we get into the next area, please
do not be offended, for the truth will be spoken and there are just
some things WE MUST deal with in the speaking of truth.&nbsp; Let us
now begin to look at ALL the particulars of our Season called
Christmas.&nbsp; First, remember where its roots are. In Paganism and
all the things they did.&nbsp; We will now see what the pagans
worshipped and why.&nbsp; We will also see how that by allowing their
rituals into the church belief, the deplorable and wicked spirits
came with them.&nbsp; We will see just how much we have been deceived
by not knowing truth, but Praise the Lord we are learning.&nbsp; I
pray you will come to know that Jesus IS NOT the reason for this
season—Satan is!&nbsp; And that is truth!!</P>

</TABLE>Have you ever just sat down and wondered why a tree set up in
our house would&nbsp; have anything to do with Jesus, His birth, or
His life?&nbsp; Why would we decorate a “TREE” with all its fancy
balls and lights and ornaments and put it in our house for the sake
of Jesus??&nbsp; Why would we&nbsp; bow before it to lay down gifts?
Let us now take a closer look and see just where this “tradition”
came from.&nbsp;

</TABLE>Since the earliest of times, trees, especially green
evergreens, were worshipped by the pagans.&nbsp; To them it
represented life and freshness.&nbsp; Since it was EVER green, it
always had life.<U> </U><U><B>The trees were worshipped as symbols of
life, fertility, sexual potency and reproduction</B></U>.&nbsp; These
pagan rituals of worship were then brought into the homes and set up
as idols, with the belief that it would give men a heightened potency
of sexual virility to procreate new life for their harvest god in the
new year.&nbsp;&nbsp; The evergreen tree represented a “PHALLIC”
symbol (the mans sexual organ of reproduction) set in an upright
position..&nbsp; Any wonder why people hang round balls on a tree?&nbsp;
Please do not be offended.&nbsp; This pagan ritual was to say the
least, very profane in the sight of God!&nbsp; There are many
scriptures that the Lord has warned us about in dealing with idols
and those things the HEATHEN do, of which <U><B>we are commanded</B></U>
to <U><B>NEVER do or imitate</B></U>.&nbsp; We are told by God to
never bring into our homes those things that are practiced by the
wickedness of the world.&nbsp; It is truly amazing at how much
“Christianity” has embraced from the trenches of the world
system.&nbsp; This is why it is time to again preach the Kingdom of
God with all holiness and obedience.&nbsp; Please read the following
scripture and know that God knew even in the days of Jeremiah the
practices and ways of the heathen. For even then, Satan was the god
of this world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen to what the scriptures say as we&nbsp;
have been warned in Jeremiah 10:1-5 about this:
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal" STYLE="margin-right: 1.2in; margin-bottom: 0in">“Hear
ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you, O house of Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thus saith the lord,<U> </U><U><B>learn not the ways of</B></U> <U><B>the
heathen</B></U> and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven;&nbsp; for
the heathen are dismayed at them.&nbsp; for the <U><B>customs</B></U>&nbsp;
of the people are vain:<U> </U><U><B>for one cutteth a tree out of
the</B></U> <U><B>forest</B></U>, the work of the hands of the
workman, with the&nbsp; ax.&nbsp; <U><B>They deck it with silver and
with gold: they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move
not</B></U>.&nbsp; They are <U>“</U><U><B>upright</B></U>” as the
palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they
cannot go.&nbsp; Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil,
neither also is it in them to do good.”</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Please meditate upon what you just read. <U>&nbsp;</U><U><B>Learn
NOT the ways of the HEATHEN</B></U> which go into a forest and cut
down a tree and then nail it so it stands upright.&nbsp; Just what do
men do today with Christmas Trees?&nbsp; Would you not say this is
more than coincidence?&nbsp; Then when the trees are brought to the
lots, they are NAILED and HAMMERED to stand UPRIGHT!! <U>&nbsp;</U><U><B>And
the blasphemy of it all is that they—The Christmas Trees—are
nailed to a wooden cross on the lots where they are sold!!&nbsp; A
wooden cross!!&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord people, open your eyes and see!!</B></U>&nbsp;
They were then brought into homes and decked out with silver and
gold.&nbsp; Sound like tinsel and ornaments?&nbsp; So much for
Christmas trees being for Jesus.&nbsp; This was hundreds of years
BEFORE Jesus was even born.&nbsp; LEARN NOT the ways of the heathen.
Everything, and I mean everything about Christmas has come to us by
learning the ways of the Heathen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds to me like
millions and millions of so called Christians have done just that!!&nbsp;
Some men and preachers today say this has absolutely NOTHING to do
with Christmas trees in Jeremiah 10.&nbsp; I would say, they need
healing for being so BLIND!&nbsp; That is spiritually blind.&nbsp;
Then again, did not Jesus say the blind would lead the blind and they
would go into the ditch?&nbsp; What an abomination to the Lord.&nbsp;
Even in the days of Jeremiah the pagans were doing this.&nbsp; Satan
knows exactly what he is doing and sad to say, so many Christians
have no idea.&nbsp; After these trees were brought into the houses,
worshipped and set upright, then gifts are now brought before them
and what must YOU do when setting a gift under the tree?&nbsp; You
must bow down before it to lay your gift.&nbsp; How sad and how
ignorant we have been.&nbsp; Thank God for opening our eyes to
truth.&nbsp; This is no laughing matter.&nbsp; Paul said to work out
your salvation with fear and trembling.&nbsp; I would pray this
brings the fear of God into your lives and in repentance we ask God
to forgive us for our ignorance and then Praise HIM for showing us
truth.&nbsp; Some would say, “But Brother, you do not understand.&nbsp;
You are being legalistic.&nbsp; We do not worship the tree, for we
know better as Born-Again Christians.</P>

</TABLE><U><B>THE YULE LOG</B></U>:&nbsp; Ever read a card or hear
“YULETIDE GREETINGS” at this time of season?
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Let us check this out also since it also has to
do with Christmas.&nbsp; The Yule log tradition dates back to
Scandinavian countries where their pagan sex and fertility god was
called Jul, or Yule.&nbsp; He was honored in a twelve day celebration
in the month of December.&nbsp; Interesting—12 days—when Israel
had 12 tribes and Jesus had 12 Apostles.&nbsp; Friends, do not be
deceived or ignorant concerning spirituals—I Cor.12:1.&nbsp; Satan
despises everything about our Heavenly Father, HIS son and the
Kingdom.&nbsp; Satan will do anything to pervert and blaspheme the
work of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; This is why all these things
happen in the world, for Satan is the god of this world.&nbsp; Jesus
said HIS Kingdom was NOT of this world—John 18:36 and for this
cause, WE should NOT be of Christmas for it is come out of the
world.&nbsp; I Jn.2:15, “Love not the world NOR the things of the
world”. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">When this season began, a Yule Log was lit and
put into the “fire place” (hell?) where the same log was used for
all 12 days to keep the fire lit or to re-light it.&nbsp; Since Jul
was the pagan god of sex and fertility, it does not take much to see
what this also represented.&nbsp; You got it!&nbsp; The lit Yule Log
represents&nbsp; again a “phallic” symbol, and being a log and
lit, it represented a good omen for heightened sexuality for the
coming year.&nbsp; It was the shadow and type of a burning lust of a
man to fuel the fires of sexual potency to reproduce fertility.&nbsp;
When one sends “YULETIDE GREETINGS”, they are basically saying,
“I greet you with this flaming log to fulfill a year of sexual
virility. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">How sick, blasphemous and perverted.&nbsp; So
much for your Christmas season being holy and of Jesus!!&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is NO WAY your Father in Heaven is glorified by your observance
of this perversion.&nbsp; Explain it away.&nbsp; Do what you desire.&nbsp;
Jesus is Lord and truth.&nbsp; <U>“</U><U><B>There is a way that
seemeth right unto man and the end thereof is death”—Prov.16:25</B></U></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U><B>MISTLETOE:</B></U>&nbsp; Just catch a girl
under the sprig of mistletoe, and she must kiss you.&nbsp; Where in
the name of Jesus Christ does this have to do with HIS holiness?&nbsp;&nbsp;
And again, mistletoe, yule logs, Christmas trees are all a part of
this season.&nbsp; Mistletoe was sacred to the druid priests and was
worshipped by them to cast spells.&nbsp; If held over the head of a
woman, she was powerless to resist, and any and all could have their
way with her sexually.&nbsp; This is where our tradition of hanging
it over a doorway to catch the unsuspecting girl comes in.&nbsp; If
the mistletoe had berries on it, then it was to make the sprig more
potent and worth more, for the berries would represent the virginity
of the woman that could be taken away and broken.&nbsp; Mistletoe, is
also a living parasite and it eats into a tree to survive.&nbsp; Lust
is also a living parasite which eats into us as trees of
righteousness if we do not crucify our flesh daily.&nbsp; Mistletoe
oil was used to anoint the foreheads of Druid Priests for service.&nbsp;
So far, we have shown you how every aspect of what it observed at
Christmas time comes from the bowels of the earth.&nbsp; It is all
sexually oriented, perverted, pagan and lascivious and we want to say
“Jesus is the reason for the season”?&nbsp; How terribly sad!</P>

</TABLE><U><B>HOLLY &amp; IVY</B></U>:&nbsp; Again, what in Jesus
name does this have to do with HIM?&nbsp; The custom of hanging Holly
and Ivy was to pay homage to the spirits that would bring life and
fertility into the home.&nbsp; The red berries on the holly was for
mans sexuality, the ivy for a woman&nbsp; around him.&nbsp; The green
leaves represented the mans potency and the berries the life. In
combination with the female ivy, it promised new life and fertility
to the entire household for the year to come.

<P CLASS="msonormal">Now we are going to get into an area that must

</TABLE><U><B>SANTA CLAUS</B></U>:&nbsp; This is probably the most
innocent, jolly, little old man of the season.&nbsp; There he is all
dressed up in his red clad suit, white collars, white beard and full
of HO, HO, HO.&nbsp; I believe the Holy Spirit would be saying, WOE,
WOE, WOE.&nbsp; He is depicted as being truly supernatural, can cover
the whole earth in one night, is attended by little elves, comes into
your homes to bring gifts to the good and lives in the North Pole. He
is depicted as omniscient and omnipresent.&nbsp; He is to know all
and watches all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Innocent enough for you?&nbsp; Let us
now expose the most blasphemous creature of them all, for behind this
mask lies SATAN himself.&nbsp; The depth of this one character alone
is beyond belief, yet we will now see the real SPIRIT behind
CHRISTMAS.&nbsp; Two figures were combined to create this being
called Santa Claus.&nbsp; First, we have Saint Nicholas, a fourth
century Bishop of the Roman Catholic Church who was a patron saint to
sailors, pawnbrokers and children.&nbsp; Secondly, we have a
Christmas spirit of a mischievous, medieval figure who encouraged
merrymaking, dancing and drunkenness.&nbsp; But let us look even
deeper.&nbsp; What you are about to see and hear is NOT COINCIDENCE
OR CHANCE.&nbsp; It is too perfect for that.&nbsp; It is well
conceived, planned and disguised and unknowing to the natural eye.&nbsp;
Let us first look at the name of SANTA CLAUS:
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><U><B>SANTA</B></U>—with just the changing and
moving of one letter, you will have SATAN!&nbsp; That is right—Satan,
the devil.&nbsp; Just move the “N” to the end and&nbsp; S&nbsp;
A&nbsp; N&nbsp; T&nbsp; A&nbsp; becomes&nbsp;&nbsp; S&nbsp; A&nbsp;
T&nbsp; A&nbsp; N…Is that unbelievable or what?&nbsp; Is this by
chance or coincidence?&nbsp; Not after seeing everything you have
read so far on “Christmas”.&nbsp; And what does Santa travel in?&nbsp;
A sleigh&nbsp; (slay) and where does he come into the house?&nbsp;
DOWN a very dark and sooty place called a chimney, right into the
FIRE!!!&nbsp;

</TABLE><U><B>CLAUS</B></U>---in this name, by using the same
letters, you have LUCAS concealed.&nbsp; Now Lucas is the root word
for LUCIFER!!&nbsp; Now, in just this creatures name, and that is
exactly what he is, you have SANTA CLAUS---SATAN—LUCIFER.&nbsp; Do
you honestly want to try to explain this away?&nbsp; Satan is the
adversary of the Kingdom of God, and Lucifer’s name meant
“Lightbringer”.&nbsp; Paul warned us to be NOT deceived, for
Satan himself is transformed into an ANGEL of
LIGHT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Isaiah 14:12-17, we have the written account of the fall of
Lucifer from Heaven.&nbsp; In his rebellion against the authority of
God, he rebelled to the WORD OF GOD.&nbsp; Do you not think that this
is his aim today?&nbsp; For he knows that rebellion to the Word of
God is the act of eternal damnation, and this is why my beloved
brethren, Christmas is SO DISGUISED.&nbsp; You cannot drink the cup
of devils and the cup of the Lord—I Cor.10:21.&nbsp; The cup of
devils is SATURNALIA---CHRISTMAS, the cup of the Lord is HIS WORD!!&nbsp;
In Isaiah 14, Lucifer said he would exalt HIS THRONE above that of
God, and upon what does Santa Claus sit on in the malls and
department stores?&nbsp; You got it, A THRONE!!&nbsp; Lucifer said, I
will ascend and sit upon the mount of the congregation in the sides
of the NORTH.&nbsp; Where does Santa Claus come from?&nbsp; The NORTH
Pole.&nbsp; In Moses Tabernacle, the shadow and type of the church in
the wilderness—Acts 7:38, it was the TABLE OF SHEWBREAD, our place
of holiest communion with the Lord, and this table was set in the far
NORTH position of the Tabernacle.&nbsp; This position belongs to
Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, the Holy Lamb of God and
SATAN wants that position of authority!!&nbsp; In the Scandinavian
countries,&nbsp; Santa Claus is called “KRIS KRINGLE” which by
interpretation means—“SON OF GOD”.&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on saints!!
How blasphemous can this get?&nbsp; How many of you are still going
to put up with this onslaught of defamation to the Holy Character of
our Lord Jesus Christ by explaining away why you still want to
observe this filth.&nbsp; Every year, SATAN has his place of being
glorified as the Son of God in the spirit world, and by the way, the
Scandinavian countries are the farthest NORTH in the World!!&nbsp;
And you want your children’s pictures taken with this spirit?&nbsp;
We should detest this with all our heart and condemn the very nature
of this holiday.&nbsp; God help us for our ignorance and even more so
now if people should still choose to honor this.&nbsp; To the carnal
mind, this all means nothing.&nbsp; To the spiritual mind, this is an
abomination.&nbsp; Let us awake unto righteousness.

<P CLASS="msonormal">As we finish on this very deceptive “spirit”,
we can see just how cunning and subtle Satan is.&nbsp; Genesis 3:1
says, “The serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field, and
in II Cor.11:3, Paul said, “But this one thing I fear, that as the
serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, he will also corrupt your
minds from the simplicity that is in Christ”.&nbsp; Everything that
Satan does is against the very authority of God and everything he
does is blasphemous to the Holy Word of God.&nbsp; Satan’s whole
purpose is to trodden under foot the Holy blood of the Lamb.&nbsp;
One last thing about Santa Claus, is his colors!!&nbsp; And please,
do not say we do not believe in Santa Claus,&nbsp; so it is okay to
observe this.&nbsp; You are missing the whole point if that is your
mentality.&nbsp; The colors:&nbsp; Red and White. Isaiah 1:18-19&nbsp;
“Come now and let us reason together saith the Lord:&nbsp; though
your sins be SCARLET, they shall be as WHITE as snow; though they be
RED like crimson, they shall be as wool.&nbsp; If you be willing and
obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: verse 20, but if you
refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured by the sword”</P>

<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What is it going to take to get people to understand the incredible
deception and blasphemy that lies behind all this?&nbsp; What is it
going to take for men of God to take a stand and teach the people
truth?&nbsp; Remember what we are talking about here—THE “SPIRIT”
behind Christmas!&nbsp; This is the true spirit behind Christmas and
there is no way that any of us can take the roots of this demonic,
ungodly, perverted, filthy order and change it to something clean,
pure and holy.&nbsp; There is no way we can explain away this
wickedness and what a shame to put the name of Jesus Christ on it.&nbsp;
We are called to EXPOSE the unfruitful works of darkness, not partake
of them—Eph.5:1-10 and only when true Born-Again believers start to
take a stand on obedience will we be able to get the world to take
notice.&nbsp; Stop trying to cover this up and explain it away.&nbsp;
Stop saying people like me and others are Pharisaic or legalistic.&nbsp;
Since when is obedience to Holiness, legalistic?&nbsp; Please
explain, I am open to hear.&nbsp; Those who read this must now make a
decision.&nbsp; Are you built spiritually upon that which men
say?--Mt.16:1-13 Or are you going to build your spiritual life off of
the TRUTH?</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How sad that this December, churches will have Christmas trees on
what is suppose to be a Holy Altar unto a Holy God.&nbsp; How sad
there will be manger scenes and pageantry plays all depicting lies
and false teachings.&nbsp; If fifteen men of God with the largest
ministries in America said, “It is okay and all right people to
keep honoring this holiday.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no harm in it and do
not let men like Kim C.Gossett rob you of your loving traditions, for
we know who WE worship”. Then I would have to say—<U>“</U><U><B>THEN
THE LORD SAID UNTO ME, THE PROPHETS PROPHESY LIES IN MY NAME: I SENT
THEM NOT, NEITHER HAVE I COMMANDED THEM, NEITHER SPAKE UNTO THEM:
THEY PROPHESY UNTO YOU A FALSE VISION AND DIVINATION, AND A THING OF
NOUGHT, AND THE DECEIT OF THEIR HEART”—Jeremiah 14:14</B></U></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brethren, Christmas is a false vision and it is full of divination.&nbsp;
Can you imagine all of this?&nbsp; Santa Claus—SATAN / LUCIFER.&nbsp;
His rebellion to the sides of the north—Isaiah.14 and he comes from
the North Pole.&nbsp; His colors of red and white blaspheme the Word
of God and the redemptive role of Jesus.&nbsp; Remember I Cor.2:14,
“For the natural (carnal) man will not understand the things that
be of God, for to him is will be foolishness, nor he can not discern
them, for they are SPIRITUALLY discerned”.&nbsp; You will NEVER
find one truth in ALL of Christmas except one—It has absolutely
nothing to do with the Father, the Son or the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; No
matter what you say or do, you will NEVER be able to change that.&nbsp;
It is strange fire unto God!!&nbsp; 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do NOT let men intimidate you if you change.&nbsp; Many say what they
say only in ignorance.&nbsp; That is why the truth is being spoken,
and my prayer is that men of God who say they are called to ministry
would truly represent Jesus Christ and share with the congregations
this truth.&nbsp; I would be more than blessed to come to any church
and minister this truth.&nbsp; I pray that men of God would be the
ones who are to represent&nbsp; Jesus Christ and stand before the
saints and say, “MY BELOVED, I HAVE HEARD A TRUTH TODAY AND AS FOR&nbsp;
ME AND MY HOUSE&nbsp; AND&nbsp; MY FAMILY, WE WILL NEVER AGAIN
PARTAKE OF THIS HEATHEN, PAGAN, DECEPTIVE HOLIDAY AGAIN.</P>

May we all take time to rest in this and maybe read it again very
soon.&nbsp; May we meditate and give thought to that which we have
heard.&nbsp; May we give thought to the Holy Word of God.&nbsp;
Brethren, I am not a weird, warped, legalistic man or Pharisee of the
Law.&nbsp; I am a man of faith, filled with the Holy Spirit of God
who loves the Lord Jesus and my Heavenly Father with every breath of
my every day.&nbsp; I will continue to expose all the false teachings
of darkness and will try to shed light where some have no light.&nbsp;
I am not a preacher of Christianity, but rather the Kingdom of God.&nbsp;
It is impossible after reading, seeing and hearing the scriptures to
take&nbsp; lightly something of this magnitude.&nbsp; Yes there will
be some who say, “DO NOT LET ANY MAN SPOIL YOUR LOVELY CHRISTMAS
TRADITIONS YOU HAD ALL THESE YEARS.&nbsp; DO NOT LET ANY ROB YOU OF
YOUR YEARLY FESTIVITIES WITH FAMILY THAT WE HAVE DONE SINCE
CHILDHOOD.&nbsp; WE DO NOT WORSHIP THE DEVIL, OR TREES OR ANY SUCH
THING”.&nbsp; My brethren, when we were Born-Again, we came into a
Kingdom that is not of this world.&nbsp; The Lord does not care if
you did this all your life.&nbsp; He is asking you to change.&nbsp;
Even as Israel grew up in Egypt, God had to lead them into the
wilderness to change them.&nbsp; We are in that wilderness today.&nbsp;
All I can say is that I love you enough to have spoken truth.&nbsp; I
have no reputation to uphold, therefore I do not fear losing people
from speaking truth.&nbsp; The Lord will build HIS house, not me.&nbsp;
I do not bend the truth to keep people and the tithes coming in.&nbsp;
I will stand on the firm foundation of the Word of God and I am not
here to please men.&nbsp; To do so would not make me a servant of
Jesus Christ—Gal.1:10.&nbsp; What I have shared I have learned by
the Holy Spirit and done research. <U>&nbsp;</U><U><B>Paul said in
Col.2:8 “Beware lest MEN spoil you through their philosophies, vain
deceit and traditions after the rudiments of this world, which are
not after Christ</B></U>”.&nbsp; A bad tree can not bear good
fruit—HIS WORDS, not mine.&nbsp; No where EVER recorded in the Holy
Writ of God will you ever find this observation called Christmas, but
what you will find in scripture after scripture after scripture is a
WARNING for us to NOT partake of everything that is found IN
Christmas.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I know it is not easy at first, but the Lord is gracious and HE will
comfort and help you.&nbsp; All HE asks for is obedience.&nbsp; Take
that first step and every year that you get further and further away
from this, your eyes will be opened more and more to see the
blindness that you once walked in.&nbsp; This whole observation has
come from the Roman Catholic Church and its “MASS” which
desecrates the blood of the lamb.&nbsp; It brings innocent children
to a deceptive spirit of GREED, COVETOUSNESS AND WANT.&nbsp; The
pressure brings men to loneliness, despair, alcohol, massive debt and
this season of the year holds the highest record of yearly suicides.&nbsp;
The exchanging of gifts comes from no where in the New Testament,
except the SPIRITUAL GIFTS we are to give to each other in presenting
our changed lives to one another.&nbsp; When the pagans went from
house to house with their little idols wrapped, this is where it all
came from.&nbsp; <U><B>If this was Jesus’ true birthday, then will
someone please explain to me WHY WE GIVE GIFTS TO OTHERS?&nbsp; If it
were HIS birthday, then should we not take all the money we spend on
others and lay it at the altar in the House of God for the work of
ministry?</B></U>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please remember, you can NOT say we
give gifts for his birthday like the wise men did, for we have shown
you they came when he was two years old.&nbsp; Thus their giving had
nothing to do with a birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus said in Mt.15, if
something is not planted by my Heavenly Father, it shall be rooted
up.</P>

</TABLE>Say what you will, the truth has been spoken.&nbsp; There
never was and never will be a Christmas in the Kingdom of God.&nbsp;
Every feast, holy day or ceremonial observation for the glory of the
Lord, was ALWAYS written in the Word of God for proper order and our
Heavenly Father, ALWAYS taught HIS people how to do something the
right way.&nbsp; For us to have any festivities or observations
listed in this teaching, it can and will be forgiven by God for our
lack of knowing.&nbsp; But once a man is instructed in truth, to not
do so is sin.&nbsp; I earnestly ask all, to pray and seek the Word of
God on this issue.&nbsp; Seek your heart and spiritual discernment.&nbsp;
And remember, right or wrong is not based on how many do something,
or how many preachers say it is all right.&nbsp; It is based upon
“WHAT SAITH THE SCRIPTURES”.&nbsp; I would rather walk with the
12 who followed Jesus’ words of life, than to follow the multitudes
in the ways of men.&nbsp; If Born-Again believers would be of one
mind, one speech and one judgment—I Cor.1:10, then a great impact
could be made.&nbsp; You will never be able to find one truth about
Christmas in the Bible.&nbsp; NOT ONE.&nbsp; And if there be not one
truth about it in the only Book that IS truth, then why make up a
soulish fantasy to observe it?&nbsp; I guess we could find ONE truth
about it.&nbsp; JESUS NEVER HAS AND NEVER WILL BE IN CHRISTMAS!!&nbsp;
If we tell our children it is his birthday, then we lie.&nbsp; If we
say three wise men came and brought gifts to baby Jesus in the
manger, then we lie.&nbsp; If we say Christmas honors the Son of God,
then we lie.&nbsp; Let us dedicate ourselves as Born-Again believers
to studying the Word of God and obeying it, ABOVE our emotions and
feelings and compromises.&nbsp; It will take boldness and courage to
tell others the truth.&nbsp; Tell them you do not observe this
holiday for it has nothing to do with the Son of God or HIS Kingdom.&nbsp;
And please do not fall into the lie that Christmas is the best time
of year to witness for Jesus!!&nbsp; Sharing Jesus and the Kingdom of
God is NOT SEASONAL!!&nbsp; It is a time of year of frantic, pushing,
shoving, horn honking, cussing and swearing people who would kill to
get a toy.&nbsp; People who damn our God and take his name in vain
daily will observe this holiday.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it is THEIR
ungodly holiday, not HIS.&nbsp; What saith the scriptures?&nbsp;
Prove all things!&nbsp; Your traditions make the Word of God on none
effect!!&nbsp; I pray you have been set free and blessed by this
teaching.&nbsp; May the Lord bless you and keep you.
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Those of you who are Elders in the faith, have a
responsibility to preach truth.&nbsp; Not your emotions and
feelings.&nbsp; You are called to stand on truth.&nbsp; NO man of God
in the Bible, again I say NO man of God in the Bible EVER observed
this festivity.&nbsp; Why do you?&nbsp; Why do you?&nbsp; No man of
God ever in the Bible observed, taught or partook of this festivity.&nbsp;
Why do you?&nbsp; Please think about that one.&nbsp; How can we say
to the children of God, LIVE ON EVERY WORD OF GOD, BELIEVE THE BIBLE
AND OBEY IT.&nbsp; Yet at the same time observe something of this
nature?&nbsp; How can this be?&nbsp; If you can say Christmas is okay
and nothing is wrong with it, then Catholics NEED not be Born-Again.&nbsp;
By your standards they are already saved.&nbsp; This came from their
spirit, not the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; A bad tree can not bear good
fruit.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">I thank the Lord Jesus Christ and the teacher,
the Holy Spirit for this freedom.&nbsp; I thank the Lord for the
faithful saints at New Covenant Christian Center, Int’l who have
dedicated their lives to holiness as disciples of Jesus Christ and
HIS Kingdom.&nbsp; There was a day in our early ministry when we at
New Covenant had our Christmas parties and year end dinners.&nbsp; We
observed and did all the things many of you do.&nbsp; I as the Lead
Elder oversaw these things and even ministered as many of you men do
today.&nbsp; As I continually grew in the knowledge of the Word of
God and continued to seek truth, the darkness was exposed.&nbsp; As I
began to research the “ROOTS” behind Christmas, seeing that it
was no where recorded in the Holy Word of God, truth was being seen.&nbsp;
As I began to see this unfold, I asked the Lord to forgive me for
ever observing this blasphemy.&nbsp; Jesus DID say that you could
blaspheme the Son of God and be forgiven.&nbsp; Therefore, I was
forgiven.&nbsp; I began as a man of God to teach the disciples here
at New Covenant these truths.&nbsp; In the beginning, some left this
House of God because of it.&nbsp; How sad to say Jeremiah 44:16-17
was being fulfilled. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">“As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us
in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.&nbsp; But we

</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">I thank God that no man has ever been forced
here to comply or change, but by the continual preaching and teaching
of truth, they have been made free.&nbsp; I am very proud of the
saints in the Kingdom of God today who so desire to love Jesus with
purity and holiness.&nbsp; How could we ever explain away that which
we now know?&nbsp; How can we still say after learning this kind of
truth, we will still do this abomination?&nbsp; Just how hard are our
hearts, I ask?&nbsp; If we are willing to not bend on this issue, how
many other issues lie in the recesses of our being that we are
willing to compromise?&nbsp; May your hearts be encouraged and I
close with this.&nbsp; For those of you that are willing to walk away
from this, your greatest adversary and greatest foe will be those who
profess to know Jesus.&nbsp; The very ones who say they love HIM,
will condemn you, unless they also be set free.&nbsp; Hold fast and
be bold.&nbsp; Stand strong as Jesus did.&nbsp; The Lord bless you.</P>

<P CLASS="msonormal">“Blessed are they which are persecuted for
righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.&nbsp;

I just ask that your correction be by the Holy Word of God.&nbsp; Let
the scriptures be that which we stand on.&nbsp; If you have a defense
for your beliefs on Christmas, just please expound them unto me by
the Word of God.&nbsp; I will argue with no man.&nbsp; May the Word
of God be exalted!!</P>
