			<h2>The Spirit Behind Birthday Celebrations</h2>
			<em>SHOULD TRUE BORN-AGAIN BELIEVERS PARTAKE?</em>
		</div>
		<div class="clearfix"></div>


		Praise the Lord and God bless all of you that shall read this teaching on this day.  As children of God, IF we be truly Born-Again by the Word of God, we are commanded by our Father in Heaven to learn and obey HIS voice at all times.  Please, I pray in Jesus name, that you will READ and &#x201c;selah&#x201d; EVERY scripture written and copied in this letter.  That is the most important part of this whole teaching.  Please do NOT just glance over or skip over any Holy Word of God recorded.  Allow the Holy Spirit to minister life to your soul this day to bring salvation to the soul in learning truth.  Let HIS ways become YOUR ways this day.<br/><br/>            Every time Jesus Christ ministered to his disciples, it was for the purpose of bringing change.  We must all remember that the VERY first doctrine of Christ is &#x201c;Repentance FROM Dead Works&#x201d;.  We must learn what dead works are in his sight, repent (change our way of thinking) and then obey.  Let us also remember saints that CHRISTIANS in the sight of the living God are NOT mere believers, as religion has deceived the masses into believing.  The Bible says, which is God&#x2019;s Holy Word spoken, that Christians were DISCIPLES of Jesus Christ.  A disciple is one who is disciplined to follow truth of the one speaking.<br/><br/>Acts 11:26<br/><br/>            And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.<br/><br/>            Whenever we encounter &#x201c;issues&#x201d; in life that arise in regards to our lives, we MUST search out and seek answers from the one and only truth available to us.  The Holy Word of God!  Jesus Christ said:<br/><br/>John 17:14-17<br/><br/>    I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. [15] I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. [16] They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. [17] Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.<br/><br/>            We see many things here, but let us just look at two.  First, Jesus prayed to his Father in Heaven just before going to Gethsemane to die to self will, that HE had given HIS disciples the WORD OF GOD.  For this cause, the world would hate them.  Does the world hate you?  Or does the world and those in the world, love you?  If it be the latter, then I pray you will search your heart to find out why. The scriptures speak openly to us that he that is friends with the world IS the enemy of God.<br/><br/>James 4:4-5<br/><br/>    Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. [5] Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?<br/><br/>            The Bible says that true disciples of Jesus Christ who are built on the Kingdom of God and NOT Christianity, will be hated by the world.  Why is this?  Because we are NOT of this world, we do not partake of the darkness and rudiments of this world, for we are a royal priesthood and peculiar people.  (I Peter 2:1-7)<br/><br/>            Then Jesus said that the Word of God is TRUTH and this is what sanctifies us.  In other words, we are made Holy in the sight of God because of HIS Word.  For this cause, may those of you who truly desire to learn truth (The Holy Word of God) and obey that truth, be blessed with this teaching.  Once again, the TRUTH shall make you free.  Many times we are snared by the devil in our ways of thinking and yet we do not even know it.  For this cause we are commanded as children of God to NOT be conformed (molded, fashioned or shaped) by this world.  Just HOW much is still in our life through observations or traditions that really violates the purpose and intent God has for us in learning truth?<br/><br/>Romans 12:2<br/><br/>    And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<br/><br/>            As we renew our minds to the ways of God, we are forever being changed from glory to glory.  We must also remember that Satan is the god of THIS world and he is the prince of the power of the air, THE SPIRIT that works in the children of disobedience.  For this cause again, Satan has a masterful plan to keep so called professing children of God in disobedience to God by blinding them from the TRUTH and continually having them hearken to the ways of this world and give no thought about it.  Why?  Because Satan knows that the wrath of God is reserved for those who walk disobediently to HIS HOLINESS in the Kingdom of God.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>2 Cor. 4:3-5<br/><br/>    But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: [4] In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. [5] For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.<br/><br/>Ephes. 2:2-3<br/><br/>    Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: [3] Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.<br/><br/>Ephes. 5:6-8<br/><br/>    Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. [7] Be not ye therefore partakers with them. [8] For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:<br/><br/>            As we can see here, may we all work out our salvation with fear and trembling, just as Paul spoke this to the Philippians.  He shared with them that only through this and obedience might we attain unto the resurrection of the dead.  We are going now to look at another very popular aspect of our lives now and line this up again with the Holy Word of God.  My deep heartfelt prayer is that once again we will NOT just push something aside, give no thought to it or deceive ourselves that it is NOT a big deal.  Really?  Since when is our disobedience to that which is recorded, &#x201c;no big deal&#x201d;?  Sadly, that is exactly what Satan wants us to think and in so doing, we lose the fear of God in our lives.<br/><br/>            Many of you reading this may have NEVER been taught about Christmas or Easter.  Many of you who profess you are Christians, many times do things that you have only known since birth.  Does that make it right?  Does that make it acceptable to God?  The only thing right and the only things acceptable to God are those things HE teaches us through HIS Word by the Holy Spirit.  Amen to that.<br/><br/>            IN this teaching, we are going to look at &#x201c;The Spirit Behind Birthdays&#x201d;.  What does the Bible say about this, if anything and what truly brought to us the celebration of birthdays, parties, cakes, candles, pointed hats, gifts and the song, &#x201c;Happy Birthday to you&#x201d;?  Should we not, as Born-Again believer, TRULY desire with all of our heart to seek these things out to find out if they REALLY bring joy to the Lord?  I would say, absolutely yes. <br/><br/>             Almost everybody, today, celebrates birthdays. Around the world, friends and relatives hold birthday parties, give gifts to the one being honored, and wish &quot;Happy birthday!&quot; to the one whose birthday is being celebrated. Have we ever questioned or just asked WHY?<br/><br/>        We know by learning the Bible that Jesus Christ himself, as well as the Apostles of God, spoke to the saints of God many times about TRADITIONS.  For the most part, traditions are of the rudiments of this world and are NOT after Jesus Christ.  Even Jesus himself said that the traditions of men can make the Word of God of none effect;<br/><br/>Matthew 15:3<br/><br/>    But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?<br/><br/>Mark 7:13<br/><br/>    Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.<br/><br/>Col. 2:6-8<br/><br/>    As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: [7] Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. [8] Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.<br/><br/>            Now, NOT ALL traditional things we do are violating spiritual principles.  We can have annual family outings to certain places which becomes like a traditional act to us, but this in itself does not violate the Word of God.  What traditions we discuss here are those we do in line with what the Bible says we are not to partake of or things we innocently do thinking we are making something spiritual out of it.  Can we truly ever substitute for Jesus Christ, or are we called to represent HIM in all things?<br/><br/>            Let us now search through the scriptures and use historical data and recorded facts to look at this issue of &#x201c;Birthday Celebrations&#x201d;.  Again, may I pray with all my heart, that we look at this in Spiritual discernment with a heart to HEAR HIS voice in this matter.  Let us see what the Bible says about this, for the Bible is to be the very words spoken from the mouth of God. <br/>

		<img style="margin: 10px; display: block; float: right;" src="img/sword2.png"/>

		<br/>Matthew 4:4<br/><br/>    But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<br/><br/>            When we search the scriptures from Genesis to Revelation, we will NEVER FIND ONE time, anywhere recorded of the Israelites in the Old to the Born-Again saints in the New Testament by the blood of Jesus EVER observing their &#x201c;Birthdays&#x201d; or celebrating the day of their birth into this world.  In fact, EVEN the very date of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ was never recorded, observed or honored by any.  Jesus Christ himself never mentioned it or taught it to HIS Apostles, nor did the Apostles when sent to the nations to make disciples and build the Kingdom of God ever teach it, observe it or honor it.  Does that NOT make us even question as to why?  We observe Christmas around the world ALL in the name of Jesus Christ, whom we say we love, yet it is NEVER recorded or observed in the Bible.  Why is this?<br/><br/>            How sad that unsaved, ungodly historical writers and authorities can tell the world WHAT  WE  ourselves ought to be saying.  Jesus Christ was born no where near December 25th, in the midst of winter and to really settle the issue, his birth date is NOWHERE mentioned or revealed to us in the Holy Scriptures.  That in itself should settle all things.  Since Jesus Christ is the head of HIS body, which is the church, which is you and I IF you be Born-Again, and HE did not observe, honor or celebrate HIS birthday, then WHY do we?  If the Apostles of God who gave us the written Word of God, by the Holy Spirit of God never recorded, taught, mentioned or observed HIS birthday, who whom WE are his body spiritually, then WHY do we observe ours?<br/><br/>Ephes. 1:22-23<br/><br/>    And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, [23] Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.<br/><br/>Col. 1:18<br/><br/>    And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.<br/><br/>            Now, saints, please give thought to this and SELAH on this today.  If the VERY day of the birth date of Jesus Christ is deliberately not revealed in scripture to us, and HIS birthday was NEVER celebrated and we are HIS body spiritually, does that not tell you something?  It should, by all means!  Why would God have us do something that HE himself never gave us or instructed us to do?  IF Birthdays were NEVER mentioned AT ALL in the Bible, or Birthday celebrations were never recorded, then we might have some permissibility to do this with no thought or no disobedience to God.  After all, we would have nothing to prove to us otherwise.<br/><br/>1 Thes. 5:21<br/><br/>    Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.<br/><br/>Acts 17:11<br/><br/>    These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.<br/><br/>            As Born-Again believers, the Holy Spirit teaches US to search the scriptures in all things to see what be so.  We are commanded by God to PROVE all things so that what we do, we do for HIS glory and honor, amen.  So let us use the Word of God to prove Birthdays and Birthday celebrations.  Does the Bible even mention this topic or subject?  Let us now see.<br/><br/>            When we search the scriptures we find that birthday celebrations or observances actually WERE recorded.  We find it twice in scripture and only twice.  The fact that something is mentioned, two or more times in the scriptures, validates by God&#x2019;s permission that we can NOW substantiate it and establish the matter.<br/><br/>Deut. 19:15<br/><br/>    One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.<br/><br/>2 Cor. 13:1<br/><br/>    This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.<br/><br/>          For this cause, the Word of God be tested and tried.  Moses was instructed by God that no matter could be established by just ONE witness, because then any could be lied about or falsely convicted by any.  Two or more had to witness something for the matter to be established.  Even Paul used this in the Corinthian epistle.  Since we have our TWO witnesses now in the twice mentioned birthday celebrations in the Bible, we can learn from them and establish the matter.  Is it for us to do, or was this a heathen, pagan honor?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>            Both times in scripture with Birthday celebrations were mentioned and recorded, BOTH dealt with unsaved, heathen, ungodly and worldly people.  First was the pagan worshipping Pharaoh of Egypt and second was the evil and wicked king Herod.  Let us search the scriptures to see what happened in both cases in the recorded Word of God<br/><br/>Pharaoh of Egypt Was the First recorded Birthday Celebration.<br/><br/> Genesis 40:20-23<br/><br/>    And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast (had a birthday celebration or party) unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. [21] And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: [22] But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. [23] Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.<br/><br/>            Now, if you remember your scriptures, you will remember that an innocent man of God, named Joseph, was IMPRISONED in Egypt during this time.  So in this first instance of a recorded Birthday celebration, a man of God was IN prison and the baker was HANGED by his head to death.  So in one celebration we see imprisonment and bondage and death.  The word FEAST is interesting in the Hebrew also.  It means to drink!!  To banquet in the act of drinking. Thus it was PARTY time, with drinking.  As with children today.  From the innocence of childhood birthday parties, comes the age of adulthood when most party and drink!!  Same world, same spirit, different year.<br/><br/>       Thus, we have recorded in the Old Testament our first witness of a birthday party celebration with drinking by a Pagan, multi god worshipping Egyptian Pharaoh.  NOT a man of God.  NOT a child of God.  Rather a Pagan King in a land God eventually delivered HIS people from!!  In so doing, remember the scriptures?<br/><br/>Deut. 12:30<br/><br/>    Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.<br/><br/>            There is something else that goes much deeper though in this.  Remember the title of this teaching.  &#x201c;The SPIRIT behind Birthdays&#x201d;.  For a moment, let us look at a few scriptures that God gave to Moses to give to the children of God who were delivered FROM Egypt.<br/><br/>Leviticus 18:1-5<br/><br/>    And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, [2] Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the Lord your God. [3] After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances. [4] Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the Lord your God. [5] Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord.<br/><br/>            We see here that when the children of Israel were delivered FROM a life they only knew in Egypt, they were not to do after the ways of Egypt.  And remember saints that Egypt in the scriptures is nothing more than a shadow and type of the WORLD today we are brought out from when Born-Again INTO the Kingdom of God.  Birthday Celebrations are seen in scripture to have originated IN EGYPT for this is the first recorded record we see.  Therefore, IF THIS CUSTOM was honored and observed IN EGYPT, then God commanded HIS children to NOT do what they saw done IN Egypt. <br/><br/>Leviticus 18:26-30<br/><br/>    Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you: [27] (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;) [28] That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you. [29] For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people. [30] Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the Lord your God.<br/><br/>            As God was instructing his children in love, he nonetheless MEANT every word spoken to Moses to speak.  Even though many of the abominable acts committed in Egypt were of sexual perversion, there still were other customs they did which God forbid Israel to observe.   Therefore, you will NEVER find recorded ONE TIME in the Old Testament where ANY of his children observed, honored or held birthday observances or celebrations.  Not one. <br/><br/>            Something else we must really be aware of and NOT be ignorant to.  When Astrologers use their Horoscopes to read the future omens of people, they truly are tapping into the occult and powers of darkness.  When people seek out their Horoscopes, which EVERY child of God ought to know to NEVER read or look upon, what are they based on?  EXACTLY!!  Birth dates and Birth days!!<br/><br/>Isaiah 47:9-10<br/><br/>    But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.<br/><br/>    [10] For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.<br/><br/>Isaiah 47:13<br/><br/>    Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.<br/><br/>            Isaiah, the Prophet of God, brought a terrible judgment upon God&#x2019;s people because of their whoring after wizards, sorcerers, enchantments and ASTROLOGERS&#x2014;THE STARGAZERS.   The whole horoscope and occultic readings put upon people come from first Birth days and Birth dates being read in the charts.  Be ware and be not deceived.  God knows SO MUCH more than we about such evil spirits and powers of darkness.  Therefore, may we just obey and KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS.<br/><br/>Jeremiah 10:1-2<br/><br/>    Hear ye the word which the Lord speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: [2] Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.<br/><br/>            Let us learn NOT the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven.  The word signs, also means omens and this is what the astrologers use.  I pray you are all being blessed in this teaching so far.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The Origin of Birthdays is recorded in Egypt.<br/><br/>            Birthdays have been celebrated for thousands of years, for this we know.   In early civilizations, like Egypt where the development of a calendar made an organized reckoning of birth dates possible, it was the horoscopes of ruling monarchs, their successors and rivals that Astrologers now used to plot future omens     Ptolemy V was an ancient Egyptian king. It was common in his day for kings and rulers to have their horoscopes made by astrologers and their birthdays were considered very important omens of the future.  They sought out their astrologers to read their futures for wealth, power and destiny.  This is why in the Book of Daniel, when Nebuchadnezzar was so troubled in a dream that he immediately sent for HIS astrologers.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Daniel 2:2<br/><br/>    Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.<br/><br/>Daniel 5:7<br/><br/>    The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.<br/><br/>            Praise God when we read the scriptures, we find out the children of the MOST high God knew MORE in truth than ALL these men of the occult.  The science of astrology is false, but nonetheless, astrologers make a very great deal out of the position of the sun, moon and stars and chart these positions from the moments of ones birth.  From this, they proceed to read ones future, their destiny in life, they talk about their wealth, their gifts or talents, their personality and character as to what type of person you are.  This is why the heathen unsaved people today always say, &#x201c;Well I am a Gemini or Pisces or Capricorn, etc&#x201d;.<br/><br/>            Astrology, is condemned as an abomination in the sight of God and it is rooted in the powers of paganism and the occult.  It brings to life mythology and deception in the world of darkness.  For this cause, stay away from it, look not upon it nor seek it out. <br/><br/>            In Egypt, birthdays were celebrated only by those in nobility and much was done to build up these times of celebrations.  Many tables were filled with foods, drinks and the festivities brought musicians and the banqueting began.  Much today in the traditions of men where a party is thrown, food served, cakes given and so forth.  As these worldly and pagan and ungodly traditions spread throughout the world, it was many times their goddesses and gods of diety that the people observed and honored.  Among the Greeks, Athena, Ares and Saturn were ALL honored and worshipped during their so called birth days. <br/><br/>            It was actually from this IN ROME, that the feast of Saturnalia, spoken more in detail on the book, &#x201c;The Spirit Behind Christmas&#x201d;, in which we saw the observance of the feast of Saturnalia after the god Saturn.  What was this feast?  It was a feast commemorating the birth of the sun-god.  From this birthday feast and pagan celebration the Roman Catholic Church birthed their own celebration in a MASS for Christ or Christ MASS which became Christmas, the birth of their son-god while the Saturnalians had their sun god.<br/><br/>            If you ever do any history reading or search out certain characters of certain people, you will find amazing things.  For instance, in Rome, the emperors always considered themselves gods.  For this cause, many of our brethren in heaven today who were martyred in Rome and burned at the stakes and fed to wild animals or the gladiatorial games, never bowed their knees to the false god emperors.  It was usually at birthday feasts where these emperors hailed themselves as gods that these things took place for their pleasure.<br/><br/>            When the daughter of Caligula, a very perverted and sick minded emperor of Rome, celebrated his daughters birthday, her name was Drusilla, a great feast was thrown.  He honored himself as a god giving birth to his goddess daughter and hundreds of animals were slain to be feasted on in Rome and days of horse races and celebrations filled the air.<br/><br/>The New Testament Order of the Commandment of God<br/><br/>            Let us now look into the New Testament.  Let us search the scriptures and see exactly what Born-Again believers are to observe and learn.  What does God say about us, as disciples of Jesus Christ and true Christians in this world we are not of, in regards to observing such things as Birthday parties or celebrations?<br/><br/>            First, who is honored at a birthday celebration?  Our Father in Heaven?  Our Lord Jesus Christ?  The power of the resurrection in the way of the Holy Spirit?  The Kingdom of God?  Our salvation?  Absolutely not.  What is honored and glorified and exalted and lifted up is OURSELVES!!  Our self life!  Our life birthed into the flesh! <br/><br/>            Let us first look at the Birthday recorded now in the New Testament.  We have already seen so far that Birthdays originated with celebrations in Egypt and how God told his children to never learn the ways of Egypt and bring that into their lives in serving HIM.  We also know their root and origin is in pagan roots and therefore, ought we to really even observe such things?  Did not God call these &#x201c;abominable customs&#x201d;?  The New Testament example we have is of an apostate and evil king named Herod. <br/><br/>   Matthew 14:6-10<br/><br/>    But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod. [7] Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. [8] And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger. [9] And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her. [10] And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.<br/><br/>            Saints, we are CALLED by God to honor, observe, hearken to and fear HIS Word.  We are not to laugh, joke, put off or justify any act of disobedience to HIS Word at any time.  What we are dealing with here is NO JOKING matter NOR is it to be taken lightly.  May we all fear God, repent and give THANKS this day for learning such blessed things.<br/><br/>            Do you see again a very similar pattern here?  First, with Pharaoh&#x2019;s birthday, a man of God named Joseph was imprisoned and a man was KILLED by being hung.  Now we see the second witness of a birthday in the New Testament.  AGAIN, a man of God is imprisoned named John and on this day he will be KILLED and beheaded.  In both cases there was a feast, drinking, partying, dancing and debauchery.  Is this what Holy children of God are to be involved with?  Remember, we are talking about the SPIRIT behind all this. <br/><br/>            Very simply put, God condemns it, says to not observe it and yet WHY do Christians who learn such truth STILL say they are not convinced and will continue to observe such?  Is there no fear of God in our lives anymore?  Just because 10,000 preachers would laugh and say this teaching is a joke or legalistic and being like a Pharisee, who would you rather face?  Them at judgment or fear the living God? <br/><br/>            Again, God said by the Prophet Jeremiah,<br/><br/> &quot;Hear ye the word which the Lord speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord, LEARN  NOT THE WAY OF THE HEATHEN, and be not dismayed at the signs of the heaven (astrology)  For the heathen are dismayed at them. For the CUSTOMS OF THE PEOPLE ARE VAIN...&quot; (Jeremiah 10:1-3).<br/><br/>            We have been showing you by the Word of God, that our Father in Heaven, who loves us, explicitly speaks and says by the Spirit, that we his children and people are NOT to follow after, observe, practice or learn to do the ways of the heathen, pagan nations before us.  Do you honestly think the scriptures speak in vain?      For this cause, we can honestly speak forth with truth and say, The Word of God does NOT approve, give permission to or permit us to celebrate or desire to get excited about BIRTHDAY celebrations.<br/><br/>            We now see in the New Testament as well, a birthday celebration.  Why was John in prison anyway?  It was because he took a stand on holiness and condemned Herod for having his brothers wife and adulterating with her.  Herod, in having his feast, partied and was emotionally moved by the dancing of Herodias daughter.  He offered her up to one half his kingdom, so she went to her mother asking what should she ask for.  She was told, the head of John the Baptist.   This was all done again at a birthday party where the flesh was gourged and gluttoned and partied upon and exalted.       <br/><br/>            God does not and will not approve or give place to our flesh.  Do not the scriptures tell us as Born-Again believers that we are to crucify the flesh?  No flesh is justified in his sight?  That which is born of flesh is flesh, therefore we must be spiritual and Born-Again?  The day of ones death is greater and better than the day of ones birth?   <br/><br/>Galatians 2:20<br/><br/>    I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<br/><br/>Galatians 5:24<br/><br/>    And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.<br/><br/>Romans 3:20<br/><br/>    Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.<br/><br/>John 3:6-7<br/><br/>    That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. [7] Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.<br/><br/>Eccles. 7:1<br/><br/>    A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.<br/><br/>

		</div>


		 <br/><br/>            When we observe the day of our birth saints, we honor our flesh and glorify that which God says we are to crucify.  Our birth into this natural world brought us into a life of sin and iniquity.  Therefore, we must be Born-Again and in so doing, we die to the old nature and put off the old man and put on the new man created in holiness and righteousness.  When Birthday celebrations are given, it is to exalt the one for whom the party is given and this exaltation lifts up the Luciferic principle within us to be exalted.  With this comes pride, covetousness and many other issues of the flesh being justified.<br/><br/>            For this cause, the Son of God never had a birth date given nor a celebration ever.  For this cause, no Israelite of Old or Blood born child in the New Testament ever had a recorded birthday celebration.  Only the heathen, pagan and ungodly world did this.  Our Father in Heaven feels very strong about this matter.  He commands his children to NOT learn, observe or DO these abominable customs.  To do so, HE said his children were to be cut off.  This may sound harsh, but because of grace in the New, can we justify this in any way?<br/><br/>Let us fear God and KEEP His commandments it says in Eccl. 12.<br/><br/>            As we said before, we see again at another pagan birthday party, a Holy man of God imprisoned and once again death came.  Should we as Born-Again Christians truly celebrate the day of the birth of our flesh?  Our flesh is wretched and evil and filled with sin in nature.  The Word of God openly and lovingly speaks truth to us.  I must say with a strong word, we should NEVER observe such issues or things.  The Bible clearly states the worship of the flesh and self exaltation is an abomination.  These Birthday celebrations truly were NOT Biblical customs to be observed by Holy Children of God.    <br/><br/>            Do you NOT think that IF Birthdays were to be observed or honored or celebrated in the sight of our Holy God that HE would have shown us this?  What about Adam, Abraham, Noah, Moses, Samuel, Elijah, Elisha or King David?  Why are the scriptures totally empty and silent concerning their dates or days of birth?  These were our spiritual forefathers in the Kingdom of God.  Of course, for geneology sake only or for chronological order of time, God knew when they were born.  We know that Jesus was 30 years old when he stepped into Jordan to being his earthly ministry according to the laws of God.  So we know the time frame was recorded ONLY for chronology of God&#x2019;s plan.  NEVER though recorded for us to know, live for, celebrate or observe.<br/><br/>            What about Jesus Christ himself?  HE is the head of the body, which is US, the church.  HE is our head, we are his body and we are seated in the heavenly realm with him as Paul said. Since our head NEVER had a birth date recorded or celebrated, then why do we?  Well, thank the Roman Catholic abomination again for false doctrine and observances.  What about the Apostles of God?  Peter, James, John, Matthew, Paul?  What about Barnabus, Silas, Timothy, Titus, Epaphroditus, Apollos or Jude?  What about ANY Born-Again believer in the Bible?  Again the answer is NONE!  No where recorded!  Yet Birthdays ARE mentioned in the Bible for those going to hell for eternal damnation for time without end.               <br/><br/>            In the sight of God, of which we should only be interested in, that actual time, date and day are of no importance other than stated before.  In Ecclesiastes again we see:<br/><br/>&quot;A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth&quot; (Ecclesiastes 7:1).<br/><br/>       Think about life.  When we are younger, we always wanted to be older.  When asked our age, we would be proud to say, 10 &#x00bd; or almost 16 or almost 21.  AS we get older, we do not desire as much to give thought to it but rather hide it.  Now when older, we want to be younger. As people get older they get lonelier, the early days of excitement and celebrations of birthdays now pass away and their fears of getting older now encompass them.  Loneliness, depression, oppression and sadness usually grip the older in life.<br/><br/>             For truth, because there was NO life in birthdays after all.  Our life is but a vapour James said and in observing the elements of this world or rudiments of this world, it is all a part of Satan&#x2019;s master plan to work in the souls and hearts of human beings, an &#x201c;antichrist&#x201d; spirit.  Birthdays cause people to look to the flesh, day of birth, self gratification, self importance, self want, self conscience, self centered, self interests and above all, we get SELF congratulations. It is all self, yet we are to die to self.<br/><br/>        I found this interesting quote written by Origen of Alexandria, in 245 A.D.  It was written in regards to customs of old and what children of God were to be looking to.<br/><br/>        Origen of Alexandria, in 245 A.D., wrote in a dissertation on Leviticus:<br/><br/>...none of the saints can be found who ever held a feast or a banquet upon his birthday, or rejoiced on the day when his son or daughter was born. But sinners rejoice and make merry on such days. For we find in the Old Testament that Pharaoh, king of Egypt, celebrated his birthday with a feast, and that Herod, in the New Testament did the same. But the saints not only neglect to mark the day of their birth with festivity, but also, filled with the Holy Spirit, they curse this day, after the example of Job and Jeremiah and David.<br/><br/>The Days of those in the Early Church in Acts;<br/><br/>          We see by the scriptures that when those saints were Born-Again at Pentacost in Acts, they that gladly received the Word of God FROM THAT DAY, steadfastly learned the Apostles Doctrine.<br/><br/>Acts 2:42<br/><br/>    And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.<br/><br/>            Of interesting note is that from THIS day, these saints learned what the Apostles of God taught and they became discipled in Jesus Christ.  To do so meant they learned to love not the world NOR the things in the world.  They were taught absolutely NOTHING about birthdays or observing them other than they were taught to crucify their flesh, honor and glorify spiritual life in Jesus Christ and to deny fleshly lusts in their daily lives.<br/><br/>            As true Christians, they were being discipled to obedience and holiness and forsaking the world.  They were taught to overcome struggles in life, overcome the power of the flesh and greed and wants and covetousness.  They were taught how powerful the flesh was and that they needed to die daily and crucify the flesh and the lusts thereof.  They were taught how the carnal mind and carnal life was at enmity with God and they were to buffet and keep under subjection their bodies and souls.  Where is that preaching today, I wonder?   <br/><br/>Please read ALL of Romans chapters six, seven and eight.  We see how these men of God longed for the day when they would be FAR removed from the vile bodies of their flesh.  Paul said, Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this wicked body.<br/><br/>Romans 7:24-25<br/><br/>    O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? [25] I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.<br/><br/>            Paul said that with the FLESH we serve the law of sin.  These men wanted to PUT OFF the old man and old nature and old tabernacle of their bodies, not glorify them, honor them, exalt them with celebrations!!  Therefore we ought not to desire with JOY to celebrate the day we were birthed INTO these earthly tabernacles called bodies, but ought to with JOY long for the day when we put them off!!  Then we have a new body, new man and new life perfected from heaven above, amen.<br/><br/>Ephes. 4:22   That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;<br/><br/>2 Peter 1:14   Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>            Saints, we have to look at the full understanding here and look spiritually to all things.  The carnal man, the carnal mind, the natural man&#x2019;s thinking is ALL against God.  Why?  Because true worshippers must worship in spirit and in truth.  We are called to be taught to live lives that will be full of trials, tests, persecutions, afflictions.<br/><br/>David said;<br/><br/>         &quot;Many are the afflictions of the righteous&quot; (Psalms 34:19).<br/><br/>Paul wrote, to us in Spirit saying;<br/><br/>2 Cor. 4:7-12<br/><br/>    But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. [8] We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; [9] Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; [10] Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. [11] For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. [12] So then death worketh in us, but life in you.<br/><br/>            Our life is to live for Jesus Christ.  Timothy was told by Paul that ALL that will live Godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.  Our joy is NOT to feed the flesh, honor the flesh, justify the flesh, party with the flesh, exalt the flesh or rejoice in the day we were conceived and born into iniquity and sin!!  We are to rejoice for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in HIS glory, amen.  We are to rejoice in what lies AHEAD, not what lies behind.<br/><br/>            Paul wrote again to the Corinthians concerning how they were to look and how they were to see.<br/><br/>2 Cor. 4:16-18<br/><br/>    For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. [17] For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; [18] While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>            There was so much Paul wrote to us concerning the flesh and how we are to be.  In this life we are only to rejoice in HIS glory and for HIS name.  We are pilgrims and sojourners on a journey in this life.  Paul said again;<br/><br/>2 Cor. 5:1-8<br/><br/>    For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. [2] For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: [3] If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. [4] For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. [5] Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. [6] Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: [7] (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) [8] We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.<br/><br/>            Not one time were the children of God ever called to glorify, exalt with joy, lift up, celebrate anything to do with their flesh.  For in OUR flesh lies NO GOOD THING.<br/><br/>            I can only pray this teaching has taken you way beyond Birthdays and celebrations. The purpose of this teaching was to expose the true spirit of disobedience that lies behind celebrating such things that God says are wrong and an abomination.  Through ignorance and willing justification of the flesh, Satan desires ALL to do things against God.  Our true hope lies in the resurrection of the dead, that moment in time when we shall all be changed in a moment of time.<br/><br/>            Our day to celebrate lies not in our flesh which identifies us to an unsaved, ungodly, heathen and pagan world.   But rather to that time when we see Jesus coming in his glory.    Why would God have us celebrate the day of our birth into this physical natural world when the Bible says we go ASTRAY immediately from the womb?  We are born into a world we are not to be of, waiting for the coming of HIS glory.  We are born BY THE FLESH into a life of struggles, persecutions, tribulations, tests trials, death, pain, misery and strife.  Yet through the POWER of the Holy Spirit, they that endure to the end shall be saved.  Glory NOT in the flesh God Himself!<br/><br/>       As Paul wrote again, and as mentioned before here, we are to FORGET those things behind and press on toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God;  Our life is ahead of us not behind us and we are to be spiritually minded not naturally and earthly minded.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Philip. 3:13-14<br/><br/>    Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind,(LIKE YOUR BIRTHDAY) and reaching forth unto those things which are before, [14] I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.<br/><br/>Philip. 3:21<br/><br/>    Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>BIRTHDAY TRADITIONS         <br/><br/>            In the World Book Encyclopedia it talks about traditions from around the world that formed and fashioned much of our present day traditions regarding Birthdays.  Let us now look more closely at these.<br/><br/>Why Birthday Cakes?   <br/><br/>            In the ancient days of Greece and Rome, many deities were worshipped as gods.  We know of the Great Goddess Diana that the Ephesians screamed for during a two hour time in rejection to the Apostles preaching.<br/><br/>Acts 19:24<br/><br/>    For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;<br/><br/>Acts 19:27-28<br/><br/>    So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. [28] And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.<br/><br/>If you would like to see more of this goddess worship, you can go to;<br/><br/>www.spiralgoddess.com   In this you will find and see a website dedicated to this goddess.  She later became the Mary worship of the Roman Catholic Church.  Diana, also known as Artemis, was the MOONGODDESS.  For this cause, her temple built in Ephesus was one of the seven wonders of the world.  Remember those from history classes?  This great wonder of the world was right in the heart of Ephesus, for which cause Paul spent three years there making disciples. He suffered much for this, but truth was preached.<br/><br/>            Since Artemis or Diana was the Moongoddess, every month during the FULL moon, cakes were baked and candles were put upon them.  The cakes were shaped round, to represent the full moon and the candles put on them to represent the light of the moon.  The Greeks celebrated her BIRTH day every month with this ceremony. This heathen goddess, whose temple was in Ephesus, was hailed as the &#x201c;MOTHER of ALL&#x201d;, &#x201c;Queen of Heaven&#x201d; and later became Mary worship to Catholics.  The ancient Greeks actually had a saying of repetition called, &#x201c;HAIL DIANA&#x201d; which is where the Hail Mary came from with rosary beads.   The high priest or priestess of this goddess, would take the round cake filled with lit candles INTO the temple before the altar.  A request or wish was made, the candles blown out and the smoke ascending was to take their request up into the heavens to their goddess.  For this cause, Birthday cakes were made round, candles put on them and wishes made and then blown out.<br/><br/>            Now saints, let us look here deeply at this.  How can any of you reading this say this abomination is okay by grace in God&#x2019;s sight or say this is no big deal because you are not worshipping Diana or Artemis?  Sadly, in ignorance you ARE!!  You have taken a heathen, pagan, god worshipping celebration and slapped your name or child&#x2019;s name on this root.<br/><br/>            This is where birthday cakes and candles and blowing them out came from.  You may think this is innocent fun, but saints deep inside the recesses of our hearts, Satan tried to gain entry to thought.  Making wishes, keeping them secret or else they may not come true, actually deceives simple hearts for some truly deep inside believe something good may still come.  It is called SUPERSTITION and that comes from the occult.<br/><br/>            Jesus said;<br/><br/>Matthew 5:15<br/><br/>    Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.<br/><br/>            Jesus also said we are the LIGHT of the world.  So what then do customs teach you to do WITH the candles or light?  BLOW them OUT, when Jesus said LET YOUR LIGHT SHINE!!<br/><br/>

		 <br/><br/>BIRTHDAY PARTIES AND HATS AND SONGS<br/><br/>            In ancient days of Druids, Celtic priests and Wizards of old, people were told that demon spirits would come on the day of ones birth into this world to possess them.  This fear gripped the heart and soul of many.  When the day of their birth was approaching, they feared being possessed or taken away by unclean and evil spirits.  So what would they do?  They felt that IF they could get into jovial moods of joy, happiness and excitement, they would ward off evil spirits.  In so doing, they began to have Birthday parties.  They would invite family and friends and have food, sings songs and give gifts to the one who might be possessed or killed on that day by evil. <br/><br/>            We all know how the Bible says that Satan appears as an ANGEL of light, right?  Well in his deceptive way, Satan used wizards to make people think they were good spiritual men and in so doing, they were the ones who would come to homes and ward off these evil spirits.  Sadly, little did the people know that Satan was using HIS messengers to bring IN these evil spirits. Anyway, because WIZARDS wore the coned shaped and pointed hats with d&eacute;cor of stars on them, soon this tradition followed for the parties.  This is WHY today, at birthday parties for children, they wear cone shaped, WIZARD hats!  Oh how Satan has dupped so many.  Praise God you are learning truth here today saints of the most high God.  By now, I pray ALL reading this will never again observe, celebrate or have anything to do with birthdays in YOUR life, let alone your children.  Remember again the Word of God!!<br/><br/>Leviticus 18:21<br/><br/>    And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord.<br/><br/>2 Kings 23:10<br/><br/>    And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.<br/><br/>            Having birthday parties with coned hats for your children is not different than burning them unto the fires of Molech which God condemned.  On the day of ones birth, because superstition and tradition made people think evil demons would come looking for them or their children, when seen on the streets or in homes, people would WISH them &#x201c;HAPPY Birthday&#x201d;. Not in the sense of how we perceive it today.  But rather they were bidding them a wish that their BIRTHday would be a HAPPY one and not demonic or sad one where evil would prevail.  In other words, it was more like a prayer than a greeting!  Have a HAPPY Birthday.  From there, a once famous song called, &#x201c;Good morning to you&#x201d;, became the tune and changed words to Happy Birthday to you. <br/><br/>            How sad this is saints.  Wizards and Sorcerers were sent to these homes with the belief they were protecting these children from Satan&#x2019;s forces. In all actuality of truth, the SPIRIT behind Birthdays,  the angel of light,  was causing them to perish eventually in eternal damnation.  Again this is why Wizards hats were molded and shaped and put on the heads of the children to protect them.  My Lord!!  And you want your children to partake of this evil?  We are commanded by God to NOT be partakers of those who walk in darkness.  Innocent is this?  By no means!!  God&#x2019;s word says that Wizards DEFILE people!!<br/><br/>Leviticus 19:31<br/><br/>    Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.<br/><br/>            For this cause, even games were created for this passing of evil spirits to others.  We were raised with PIN THE TAIL on the DONKEY.  Remember that.  We were BLINDFOLDED, in other words put into darkness!  Then spun around to make us dizzy, meaning to LOSE your senses AND sense of direction in life!!  Then a paper tail was put in your hands and you were to BLINDLY find you way through to come as close as possible to the mark.  The one closest either received a prize OR was given a charm of luck for the year ahead!!<br/><br/>            Every custom and every tradition and every observance of these birthday parties for us had to do with guessing the coming year, the future, good wishes or good luck charms against evil spirits in your life so that NO harm would come to you.  All these games and rituals saints were suppose to work a so called magic in the year ahead.  Once again, even magic is condemned of God and we are told to stay away from it. It is truly from the occultic world of darkness and evil.     Now ask yourself this.  Should any of us as Born-Again Christians have anything to do with such occultic practices?  Ceremonies or celebrations?  Should we be involved with anything that is from the pagan worship of pagan gods or allow our children to be involved?<br/><br/>            You may have been ignorant to all these things, much like I was in my upbringing, but NOW in knowing truth, how can I or you ever go back and do these things anymore?  To him who KNOWS what is right and good and though he does it not, it becomes SIN to him.  JUST what Satan wants.<br/><br/>James 4:17<br/><br/>    Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION; <br/><br/>2 Cor. 6:14-18<br/><br/>    Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? [15] And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? [16] And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. [17] Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, [18] And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ephes. 5:6-15<br/><br/>    Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. [7] Be not ye therefore partakers with them. [8] For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: [9] (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) [10] Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. [11] And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. [12] For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. [13] But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. [14] Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. [15] See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,<br/><br/>            Need anymore really be said?  How much more would need to be written for you to believe the truth of God&#x2019;s Holy Word?  I pray with all my heart you OPEN your spiritual eyes and see.  Do NOT explain this away and do NOT say this is all innocent.  Do NOT be blinded by the god of this world and think that I as a man of God who proclaimed truth to you is just legalistic or a Pharisee.  Take this to heart.  REPENT (change your way of thinking). Be set free this day and rejoice that God loves you enough to give you truth.<br/><br/>       In God&#x2019;s sight, Birthday celebrations and Birthday parties are unclean things.  They are from pagan and wicked practices of the dark side.  They knew NOT the true God we serve and we are to have nothing to do with any of it.   May the Holy Spirit of Truth enlighten your eyes and allow you to see the depth of this error.  May the Holy Spirit of God bring conviction to your hearts and strength to walk away from this darkness.  May we all obey this day as disciples of Jesus Christ and openly IN LOVE teach our children truth.<br/><br/>            DO NOT FEAR speaking truth to your children and FEAR NOT thinking that you are taking something special from them.  You are taking HELL from them and disobedience to God.  Therefore, rejoice!!<br/><br/>            God said;<br/><br/>Hosea 4:6<br/><br/>    My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.<br/><br/>1 Kings 18:21<br/><br/>    And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.<br/><br/>Isaiah 53:1<br/><br/>    Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?<br/><br/>John 12:38<br/><br/>    That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?<br/><br/>Romans 10:16<br/><br/>    But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?<br/><br/>            Whose report are you going to believe?  I and my household will believe the REPORT OF THE LORD.  God bless you all.
