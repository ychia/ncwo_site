		Beloved Saints;<br/> <br/> I greet you all this night in Jesus most precious name. I write with a great, very great burden in my heart and ask YOU ALL, to please hear the voice of your Shepherd this night. In the next day or so, OR this very night, should the Lord wake you at the Midnight Hour to pray and hear this AUDIO teaching below, then so be it.<br/> <br/>Psalm 119:62 <br/>    At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.<br/><br/>For the past TWO weeks, saints, I have been in many fastings on and off. My heart cries and my spirit is burdened with deep pains and fears. As I press into the Word of God daily, the Lord has been revealing SO many things to my spirit. God IS speaking to me saints, as HE desires to speak TO YOU. Yet on my knees I go, morning, nights. I sit at the side of my bed at night weeping for the hurts and pains I carry. More today than ever before. I am a servant of God, broken, an emptied vessel, yet HE fills me more and more daily and nightly saints with HIS word. HE, MY LORD, awakens me at night, many times, around 2 AM or 4 AM and I lament in groanings over things the Lord reveals. Below, I have a link saints to an audio teaching of WEEPINGS by a man of God. I am asking for YOU all, to listen to this weeping Prophet of God, David Wilkerson, as the Prophet CRIES--&quot;A CALL TO ANGUISH&quot;. Saints when a Word is spoken IN SEASON, it will last till the Lord returns, for when impartation takes place, God expects results. I ask you as well, to hear MY cry this night for you all, as well as myself. LISTEN to the WORD of God we speak saints, BY THE SPIRIT. Elders are called of God to take OVERSIGHT TO YOUR Souls, yet how can we IF you refuse to hear OUR word? Selah.<br/> <br/>Since I have been back from Africa, MANY of you have seen changes in my heart, spirit and the beckoning call within me to HOLINESS, RIGHTEOUSNESS and the FEAR of God. Many of you have shared with me, &quot;Brother Kim, there is something different about you&quot;. Saints, it is the Holy Spirit within me beckoning ME to a greater crying unto God, beckoning ME to more prayer on my knees, beckoning ME to fast more and SEEK HIS WISDOM. Beckoning ME to a greater FEAR saints. My times in Africa were lonely, filled with despair, and instead of drowning myself in the world, worldliness, TV's, movies, I immersed myself in prayer, the Word, pressing INTO the Lord day and mostly at night. I saw SO many exposed in Africa who said they LOVED Jesus, but they refused to hearken to HIS voice through HIS servant. When I left you all on Sept.6th, I already had an empty void within me, and when I returned, I came back saints a different man.<br/> <br/>As a man of God, I GRIEVE today saints to see the LUKEWARMNESS of so many. Many who say they Love Jesus, literally have NO FEAR, they say they are walking with God, when they have NO comprehension of what that walk is. Saints, many today do NOT hearken to, NOR seek the Apostles and Prophets of God, yet I call for you all this night to HEARKEN dearly. As YOUR shepherd Saints, at New Covenant, I ask you TO OBEY the Word saints, OBEY IT to every jot and tittle. David Wilkerson IS a Prophet of God saints, and New Covenant is blessed with the Apostolic and Prophetic. My heart weeps and breaks today to see many say they love Jesus, but have no desire to KNOW him. We are called to live on our knees saints, and we have failed God so much in this area. This is why so many say they love Jesus, are going on with him in life, yet They live in carnality, sin, and hearts are so hardened.  We live in an hour Christians are making their OWN decisions, expecting the love of God to honor them, which will be the greatest lie of the devil, for on THAT day, God will HONOR NO ONE, that does not fear HIM, nor hearken to HIS counsel!! Churches are FILLED today with LUKEWARM professing Christians. People are FULL OF jokes and laughing and taking life so lightly, when the BIBLE says we are to BE SOBER, WATCHFUL and ALERT at all times, fearing God and watching OUT for the devil. Many are sleeping with the devil and think they are loving Jesus!!<br/> <br/>We live in a hour Jesus WARNED us about, in the last days of great deception. Jesus said MANY would come in HIS NAME, saying they are OF HIM&lt; when they deceive many around them. Jesus said in the last days, ONLY A FEW will know the right way saints, and a remnant shall be saved. I LONG FOR YOU to be a part of that remnant. BUT JUST believing in Jesus will NOT get you into heaven. WE have Christians living in rebellion, SIN, having no desire to FEAR God, get in HIS Word, on their knees, obey HIS voice or fear that which is coming. WHERE is the fastings saints?????  Where IS the death to the flesh??? Crucifiction was PAINFUL!!!  Are you pained to live the life of Christ?  Do you wives FAST FOR YOUR HUSBANDS??  Do you HUSBANDS FAST for your wives?  DO YOU FAST FOR each other?  No wonder so many marriages seem dead. We live in an hour of lasciviousness, adulteries of their bodies and in some, thoughts, for Jesus said IF you look upon a woman in lust, YOU commit adultery. We live in an hour where Christians walk away from marriages with NO FEAR of the judgments coming, and NO FEAR to repent and lay and weep before God to be restored. Woe be to us IF we do not obey HIS voice.<br/> <br/>We live in a day of great fleshy lusts ALL around us and TV and Whoredoms and LUSTS permeate the air and INFLUENCE our minds more than we know. WE need a CLEANSING OF THE HEART saints and we NEED to REPENT!!  . NO wonder so many die. Our TV shows are filled with adulteries, fornications, rebellion to parents by children. Fornications, laughter, homosexuality accepted and half hearted Christians, walking aimlessly with no hunger, no desire to seek the Lord on their faces, OR seeking out holy men of God to bring CONVICTION to truth. We live in an hour, when Christians SEEK others to give them counsel in what they WANT to hear, to justify their sins and rebellion, just as Paul said in II Tim.4. For the hour will come in the last days when they will NO LONGER endure sound doctrine, but HEAP TO THEMSELVES teachers having itching ears. Saints, IF your Elders EVER come to you with the Word of God, EMBRACE it and FEAR God. Even David Wilkerson will talk about how when men of God come to YOU and say they SEE you are changing, YOU BETTER fall before God in prayer and SEEK what are these men seeing. Elders are called to FAST and PRAY and LEAD you and PROTECT you. Yet many do not even care to seek us out.<br/> <br/>People who run FROM true men of God, instead of running TO them and crying OUT, What must we DO, are a people with no fear and only desire to fulfill their own lusts IN JESUS name. And IF this letter this night OR this audio by Brother David exposes your heart, then REPENT and know YOU are loved and NOT condemned. BUT if you do NOT humbly repent, THAT day will condemn to outer darkness. Be not deceived saints. God is CRYING FOR HIS PEOPLE in this hour of apostasy.  Since I have been back from Africa, my tears have wet my pillow at night many times. My heart is broken, weeping and crying out to God more than you know. EVEN before I left for Africa, as I shared with you all again this past Sunday, I spoke to you all about being ON OUR KNEES in prayer, like Jesus in Gethsemane for GODS WILL TO BE DONE, not ours, I have cried for marriages. IS THAT NOT true? For the past year, I have shared many times, WHY God commands our marriages to be holy and sanctified, and IF sin comes in, FORGIVE and pray and STAND strong, but do not depart. AND IF you depart, you are bound still, unless you reconcile saints, for that COVENANT CAN NOT be broken. I see marriages in trouble at times, or walls being built, and I have only shared HIT YOUR KNEES and pray, have I not?  God commands you wives, that IF your husband&#x2019;s to not obey the Word of God, then do NOT speak against them, do NOT depart from them, do NOT get angry with them, HIT YOUR KNEES and pray.  Marriages are the KEY to the Kingdom saints. Paul talked about them in all his epistles, for It is the HIGHEST COVENANT of God outside salvation. Before I left for Africa, I was asking all you husbands and wives, to be on your knees together, praying together, being strong together and exercising the HOLINESS found in I Cor. 7 about separating naturally with each other for prayers and fastings. Why? Because SATAN is busy, working to destroy and DECEIVE and blind the minds in many ways. YET God is the answer in all ways. HAVE YOU obeyed? I pray to God so.<br/> <br/>These past two weeks, I have spent more time on my knees than ever before in my life. Crying out to God for deliverance and for the saints. We live in an hour of such great disobedience saints, we are allowing the TV's and movies and videos to KILL US, destroy US and bring nothing but mere flesh into our homes and lives. I see NO fear in many today, no SANCTITY in covenants of marriage and where IS that holiness God spoke of?  Wives, REVERENCE your husbands, THAT is a commandment of God, and do them good ALL the days of your lives!!!  And husbands LOVE your wives as Christ loved the church and protect them with the Word of God.  When the sun sets, if you had a bad day, LOVE EACH OTHER IN CHRIST and embrace the beauty of your covenant. If any of you fall short, or sin, FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER and let your love grow STRONG IN Jesus Christ. The adamic nature ALWAYS thinks running away is the answer, starting anew, when it is death and shall be always.  Raise your youth and children in holy sanctification by being those examples. I have been listening to David Wilkerson SO much these past weeks, even I am provoked to a greater depth of humility.  I have watched his LIVE Videos from Times Square Church and heard his live audios, one of which I send to you all  this night that was a few years back but SO RELEVANT to this hour we live in. DO NOT let condemnation hit you when exposed, let GRACE and MERCY and obedience to repent, arise within.<br/>

		<br/>Saints, we are getting close and running OUT of time. This audio message A CALL TO ANGUISH will move your heart, move your spirit, cause you to REPENT with Godly sorrow for ever hurting the Lord or making HIM cry. YES, saints, we make Jesus CRY, for we know NOT the hour of our visitation. Yet when we truly repent, with GODLY sorrow, OBEY Jesus and DO what he says, HE FORGIVES us and his blood covers us and we arise and go on.  BUT we must always return to the path HE put us on and never deviate from it. When I was in Africa, I NEVER in my life saw SO many who said they loved Jesus, but they would NOT hearken to the Apostolic within me, nor the prophetic. I may not be strong in the Prophetic, but I am growing stronger every day in the Apostolic saints. Yet I know the prophetic saints and at times, I GRIEVE for the body of Christ today. DAILY I ask God to humble me, create in me a CLEANER HEART saints, and cause me to CONDEMN THIS WORLD more and hate evil and hate sin, yes HATE SIN. Be not deceived saints, GOD HATES SIN!!!!!!!    I KNOW the Word and I KNOW the Spirit and I KNOW The grievings HE puts in me. For years, the Lord has SHOWN me things that others hide. I SEE and hear HIS cry as God DESPERATELY is trying to save the lukewarm and deceived.<br/> <br/>This beckoning call from brother David, is powerful and it is time saints for us to HEAR what the Spirit is truly saying to the church. I am asking that ALL you husbands and wives, you can listen to this by yourselves, yes, but I am asking to find the time SIDE BY SIDE, this week, sitting together with your Bibles to hear the CRY of the Prophet here as he weeps before the Lord.  Where is the fear of God today saints? Where are those who REPENT the right way, and come running to God ON THEIR KNEES weeping for their sins? Where are those who SIN, fall away, repent and return? There are very few. Yet YOU must return from where you fell. THAT is what Jesus said. The prodigal WENT HOME when he repented, and in Revelation 2, when Jesus talked to those in the church who LEFT their first Love (Jesus), he told them after they had fallen away, that they HAD to REMEMBER from WHERE they fell from, not from whom. FROM WHERE THEY fell, and he said REMEMBER it, then repent, then you MUST go back and do YOUR FIRST WORKS.  That means you have to go back to WHERE you were when you sinned against God. Of course, I am NOT talking Christianity or talking about you being in some DEAD CHURCH. I am talking about KINGDOM. That is why saints, we WILL see more and more come back to New Covenant  who left over the years. WE WILL see it saints as we PRAY FOR THEM. This is again why in your marriages, God commanded that IF you leave one another you remain single till one dies, or be reconciled. ONLY in death, can one be free. And God is NOT MOCKED saints. There is a day coming we will TREMBLE in the presence of the Lord. A day coming where the carnally blind will weep in anguish themselves. Remember saints, you are BUILT upon the foundation of Apostles and Prophets, who speak truth in fear.<br/> <br/>I PRAY THIS this message will burn in your hearts as the word did with those who walked to Emmaus. <br/> <br/>Luke 24:32 <br/>    And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?<br/><br/>I long saints for the Word of God to BURN in your hearts with HOLY GHOST conviction, yet IF our hearts are hardened, we will forsake such a beckoning cry of God. THIS is a day to repent saints, PURIFY our hearts, BURN with the zeal and fire of God. This is a day saints to FORGET what is behind, FORGET Jesus said, and PRESS ON TO WHAT LIES AHEAD. IF you live your lives living off ISSUES of your past, you will die today and not see LIFE for tomorrow.  This is A day to learn to WEEP before him and seek HIS voice and purpose and NOT ours. It is a day to hear HIS LOVE for us, and HIS beckoning call to obedience and be NOT deceived. And remember saints, THOSE deceived in life, do NOT know they are deceived. THAT is why if MEN OF GOD come running to you with OPEN Bibles and words of conviction, LISTEN to their counsel for in the MULTITUDE OF COUNSELORS there is SAFETY. It is a day saints, to hear the voices again of the Apostles and Prophets, and CRUCIFY our flesh by carrying YOUR cross, by going to Gethsemane first. Did not Jude speak about the last days? Absolutely and he said HEARKEN to the voices of the Apostles of Jesus Christ. WE live in a day saints where SIN IS RAMPANT in the hearts of so called Christians, who FORSAKE Jesus and bring shame to the REAL Jesus.<br/> <br/>Jesus told his OWN disciples to TAKE HEED that the light that be IN you, be NOT darkness. Selah again. They say &#x201c;LORD, LORD&#x201d;,  but they do NOT what he says. We live in a dangerous hour where Christians say I will do this and I will do that and I will go here and I will not do that, yet few fall on their faces in anguish saying LORD what will YOU HAVE ME DO!!  We live in a hour of no prayer power, no knees, no PRESSING in. We live in a lukewarm society and a valley FILLED WITH DEMONIC forces. This valley will KILL you spiritually if you are NOT DAILY prepared saints. We get up, shower, go to work, get FILLED with the fleshly ways around ungodly souls or LUKEWARM professing Christians, and give a moments glance. We spend ALL day be dirtied by the filthy world and those around us cussing, swearing, taking our Lords name in  vain and we say NOTHING!  We live and work in places where LUST ABOUNDS daily, men lusting for women, women lusting for men and they are NOT even married. THAT is truth saints, and YOU are in the midst of it daily. You think this does NOT affect YOU??   We then go home, WATCH TV for the rest of the night and DIE spiritually. Saints ARISE. Husbands LONG to be with your wives, from the moments you get up in the morning and leave to when you get home and see them in the evenings. WIVES LONG to be with your husbands, honoring them, serving them, caring for them and pleasing them. FOR this is the will of God. GET BEHIND THE BLOOD in your homes!!!!<br/> <br/>My heart is broken more today saints than ever before, and yet to my dying breath, I will preach holiness, righteousness and the FEAR of God. May you ALL hear this teaching, this preaching on this audio and may your hearts be pricked. I pray some of you tonight who are growing cold, or doubting your husbands or wives, you REPENT and get on your knees and PRAY IT THROUGH and God will VISIT you with his love and presence. BUT KNOW this, Paul said the day of judgment would be the TERROR of the Lord in II Cor. 5. I pray we truly saints, TRULY become Kingdom people like never before. Husbands embrace your wives and children, wives embrace your husbands, for God commands it, and never violate what God has given you. SAINTS, God will NOT slack on THAT day. BRING Jesus Christ INTO your hearts, your homes, your lives, your marriages. Arise in the morning and PRAY, read the Word, THEN shower and go to work. Witness to those at work and CRY for your unsaved family members. IS your life a testimony saints to your unsaved families?  ARE you separated from the world and living the life they SEE is different? Do you pursue your bosses, your co workers to COME to the House of God on Sundays to hear HOLY MEN OF GOD preach? Do you COMPEL your unsaved family members IF they be in this valley to RUN WITH YOU to the House of God? IF NOT, then we have failed and we need to be forgiven. Oh, saints, listen to the CRY of the Prophet in this CALL TO ANGUISH, and please hear mine tonight.<br/> <br/>God's Word IS HIS Word. Many will run to hear what any will tell them to give them what they WANT to hear. Come to me saints and I will give you what HE WANTS YOU TO HEAR. Come to Charles, Frank, Luke, and they will give you WHAT GOD WANTS YOU TO HEAR.<br/> <br/>Hebrews 12:25 <br/>    See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:<br/><br/>God bless you and be ye holy for holy is HE that has called you. God will NEVER separate you, nor put you asunder, Selah. Your servant in the Lord, brother Kim
