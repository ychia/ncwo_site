		Praise the Lord and God bless you Brother Greg and the Elders in the Philippines. I greet all of you dear God fearing saints this day, and greet all you faithful Elders serving in Africa, India and here in the USA as well. Many times, when God places DEEP in the heart, something SPIRITUAL for HIS people to hear, it is hard many times to put into words. I sit at times and truly am humbled saints, yet ask the Lord, HOW DO I get them Lord to SEE and KNOW what I am feeling and seeing and you are asking me to try to convey?  It is not easy at times.<br/> <br/>I can ONLY pray saints, you take to HEART, truly that which the Holy Spirit is revealing to us. I humbly ask you to increase your prayer times, knee times, Word study times and truly seeing this world for what it IS. One can NOT reason with God in their natural mind or thinking. It is because of THAT, so many honestly believe they are walking with God, hearing his voice, when they are not. Jesus said, God was SPIRIT and TRUE worshippers, must worship HIM IN Spirit and IN truth: When you get on your knees you get INTO Spirit, and in HIS Word, into truth.<br/> <br/>John 4:23-24 <br/>    But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. [24] God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.<br/><br/>I am doing all I can saints to POUR OUT my heart and soul and spirit to you all. I have encouraged you husbands and wives, to get side by side, hand in hand, ON YOUR knees in prayer as you seek the Lord and desire HIS SPIRITUAL revelations. Some of you have struggled in your marriages, yet ON YOUR knees you will find healing and in loving each other, you shall arise and see HIS truth.  I have asked all to fast, pray, get your Bibles, sit down with notebooks and write what the Holy Spirit SPEAKS to you AS you study the Word daily. Saints, YOUR FATHER in heaven, LONGS to talk with you, LONGS for YOU to hear HIS voice, LONGS to commune with you. BUT we cannot come into HIS holy presence with dirty minds, dirty hearts or dirty lives. KEEP YOURSELVES PURE.<br/> <br/>I have shared from my heart, how the Lord is asking HIS PEOPLE to get OUT of this world, OUT of carnality, OUT of fleshly lusts and OUT of being dirtied by this filthy world. I have shared with all my heart saints, for you to RUN HOME after work, after your jobs and bring Christ INTO your homes and marriages, with your families and youth and children. Saints, we are living in unprecedented times. Today, the Holy Spirit truly graced us with KNOWLEDGE and WISDOM and insight to truth. We MUST SEE sin through God's eyes. That is the title of  the message at the House of God today. I pray this week, you will hear LAST weeks again AND hear today. Exodus 32 HAS LIFE saints, and shows WHY we must know HOW God sees sin and it will SHOW you, WHY Jesus suffered so much for us.  Take this with your Friday nights in learning of the CROSS OF CHRIST and surely, you shall be blessed.<br/>

		<br/>Thank you Greg for writing your letter today, which I shared from the pulpit toward the end of the service. I was blessed to hear even what the Lord is doing in YOUR heart and your families and the saints in the Philippines. I was blessed to hear you share about Brother Terry sharing that letter I wrote weeks ago about, THE SACRIFICE it takes to live for Jesus IN a world we are NOT of. Selah. When many are perishing in rebellion today, sin, adulteries, fornications, rebellion, lasciviousness, we need to TRULY get back to the fear of God, repentance and cleansing, or else we shall also be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. ALL GOD asks in HIS LOVE, is repent, be cleansed, stand upright and go back to where you were and begin on that path again and LIFE will be yours. Few find that truth.<br/> <br/>I am blessed to know God IS speaking to us all right now in a very serious beckoning call. Yet my heart breaks, when many do NOT hearken, or they take lightly HIS Holy warnings, OR they think it is only flesh and blood men speaking. My journey to Africa opened my eyes more than ever before and EVEN Paul, a humble servant, yet great God fearing Apostle of God, GREW from his experiences. I witnessed many transgressions and sins of the hearts in Africa, and this broke my heart. Therefore, experiences like that, caused me to spend MORE time in prayer crying unto the Lord. Therefore the men of God in the Bible GREW with the Lord in their experiences, and I pray to grow from mine. We MUST cleanse our hearts saints and we MUST sanctify the Lord in our hearts. WE MUST fear God saints and KEEP HIS commandments. How is it, some just will NOT hear HIS Word?  It is because HIS Word just might cause them to do what they do NOT want to, so many are deceived. ON THAT day, HIS Word will surely tell you and you have no choice. HOW can I speak scriptures, yet some will NOT hear? We live in a day when those like Jeremiah wept, for he delivered THUS SAITH THE LORD, yet was cut off by Israel: <br/> <br/>Jeremiah 44:16 <br/>    As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.<br/><br/>They acknowledged the Word of God but REFUSED to hearken to the man who delivered it. This must have broken Jeremiah's heart, for I know it breaks MINE. I try with ALL MY being to save souls and KEEP those who say they love Jesus IN LINE with truth. Yet many think, only flesh and blood of a man is speaking. God help us all saints. We Elders are here to LOVE you and protect you. And you wives to Elders remember YOU have a much greater demand put on your life, due to the callings of your husbands. You never asked to be joined to these men in ministry, but GOD CHOSE you, Jesus ordained you and the Holy Spirit anointed you, therefore be honored and blessed and give thanks for such suffering set upon you that will come. Selah.<br/> <br/>Today was another powerful day, in Spirit. I shared saints, with you all, how when I stand before you, or Elders stand, we are only vessels by which the Spirit brings forth HIS Word. Last week, on Sunday, May 9th, when I left the House of God, I KNEW in my own spirit, it was a powerfully anointed day. I could FEEL it. So this week, I sat in bed the other night and opened up Box.net and listened again to HEAR HIS CRY from last Sunday. This time saints, I was on the RECEIVING end, not the giving end. And I was ministered to by the Spirit. As I laid in bed, listening to this teaching on my laptop, I went to every scripture mentioned and HEARD in my own heart, that which the Spirit ministered. It was a powerful message saints and the Holy Spirit IS SPEAKING in this hour to us here. He that hath ears to hear, LET HIM SURELY HEAR.<br/> <br/>Today, I shared saints something VERY important to get down into YOUR spirit. YOU MUST see sin through God's eyes and NOT yours. I showed you saints, in Ex.32, all Moses went through PLEADING with God to not judge HIS people with wrath and anger for their sins. Yet, God told Moses to go down from Mt. Sinai and when Moses came OUT FROM the presence of a Holy God and MOSES NOW saw with his OWN eyes, the sins of Israel, NOW HIS WRATH WAXED hot. In other words saints, earlier he was pleading with God to spare HIS people from their sins, but NOW saw them through the eyes of God and it was MOSES that brought judgment. Selah.  He told Israel, you have sinned a great sin this day. Because of grace and the blood of Jesus, do we sin saints, with no conviction? GOD FORBID. How much MORE ought we to hate sin, for we are saved NOT BY THE BLOOD of bulls and goats, but by the blood of JESUS CHRIST!! Let us NEVER trodden under foot that blood as it says in Heb.10. God IS doing a great work in you all saints, but let's stay SOBER and watchful for Satan is really loose in this day and hour.<br/> <br/>Saints, UNTIL YOU, yes YOU get on your knees, into the Word of God, prayers, fasting, UNTIL YOU PRESS in and condemn the world and get alone with a HOLY Father in heaven, ONLY THEN will you see sin through HIS EYES and in this, you will hate it, despise it and abhor evil!!!  Yes saints, the Fear of God is to HATE EVIL:  When you condemn the world and get it OUT OF YOUR HOMES, you will hate evil.<br/> <br/>Psalm 97:10 <br/>    Ye that love the Lord, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.<br/> <br/>Proverbs 8:13 <br/>    The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.<br/><br/>If we as GODS PEOPLE, do not HATE SIN, then what hope do we have for eternity? IF we do not hate sin saints, then HOW DO WE REALLY know what we were saved from? We do not, and for that cause, FEW FEAR GOD anymore. THIS is why God said come OUT from amongst the ungodly, OUT from amongst the unclean, OUT from amongst the unsaved, OUT from amongst the carnal. THEN HE will be your Father, amen. THOSE who profess to know God and do NOT HATE EVIL have not yet seen sin through God's eyes. Please read Ex.32 again. THIS is why Saints, the Apostles of God in the New Testament, the New Covenant written in HIS blood, these men HATED EVIL. They warned saints about SIN, and what sin does to kill the heart, especially sexual sins which KILL THE HEART AND SPIRIT. Though persecuted, they stood fast. Though railed on, lied about and hurt terribly, they stood fast. In my own life saints, I have SUFFERED much, been put through much, which God never intended his son to suffer in.  Yes, we suffer for righteousness sake saints, and suffer from what the heathen bring forth, but God have mercy when we suffer from what Christians do.<br/> <br/>May FORGIVENESS and mercy be asked by all who offend. YET, I never have forsaken my Lord, never left my calling, never left the House of God, never left the altar and ministry and never left you. I have never left the SENT ministry saints, and though I have been devastated in life by what many have done over many years, what many have done to New Covenant, I love Jesus MORE and FEAR ever leaving HIM or my calling. I pray saints you never leave also. Fight the good fight and suffer for HIS sake, that you may KNOW Christ. We are in a very HARD, PERILOUS time in life. Sin is abounding and yet God wants HIS grace to abound. Darkness is grossly exploding around us, yet Jesus said YOU are the light. Saints, IF YOU SIN, do NOT be ashamed, do NOT be condemned. BE CONVICTED, repent, stand before the Lord and his people asking forgiveness and let HIS LOVE heal, amen to that. We have all sinned, but Saints, God's love is greater than our sins, IF we repent and let HIS guide us back.<br/> <br/>We saw again today from Ezekiel 11 &amp; 36, that UNTIL GOD IS SANCTIFIED IN YOU, HIS people, only then will heathen KNOW our Holy God. AND, once HE is sanctified and you are truly cleansed, ONLY THEN do you see the depth of sin within you and you loathe your own sins , your own uncleannesses, your own despicable ways, as God said. And HE LET's you and I see the evil we did. To condemn us? Oh my NO saints, to let us KNOW how PURE HE is and what a price was paid FOR OUR SINS. When we truly SEE sin through God's eyes, WE SEE JESUS MORE and what HE went through for us and it causes us to live a HOLY, GOD FEARING LIFE. God said that in Ezekiel, not me.  HOW can people KNOW the God we serve saints, IF we walk with them in carnality, lukewarmness and have NO CONVICTION of truth? We have so many professing Christians today saying they love Jesus, are getting right with Jesus, say God is with them, when God is WARNING THEM through Apostles and Prophets. YOU are the light saints and YOU are sent out daily on your jobs, work, with co workers, HOW much do you witness during the week?  IF I had box.net in my day when I worked at National Semi back in the 80's, I would personally copy it on note cards and give to ALL my workers and tell them to go home and LISTEN to the HOLY preaching and then ask them to meet me in the House of God!!! Did not Jesus tell YOU and I to go to the highways and byways and COMPEL PEOPLE to come into HIS HOUSE? HE sure did.<br/> <br/>So saints, be bold and be of good courage. Saints, REPENT and let the scriptures burn in your hearts. Those walking the fence, being lukewarm, or those who hearken NOT TO THE VOICE of your Elders or Shepherds in the Bishop ministry, REPENT today, before THAT day comes and it be too late. KNOW that God loves you so much and WANTS TO HELP you, but you must come HIS WAY and OBEY HIS voice to find life. For on THAT day, you will have no chance to repent! The love of God is SO GREAT saints; HE IS SPEAKING TO PROTECT us. Let God protect you. And again saints, GOD SO LOVES US, HE is desperately trying to PROTECT us from what is here and coming. IF you question or feel you do not understand something, HIT your knees, fast, pray, and seek wise counsel. Call upon your Elders, seek their insights and pray and allow God to protect you from the great deception around us.<br/>

		<br/>1 Tim. 3:15 <br/>    But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.<br/> <br/>1 Peter 4:17 <br/>    For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?<br/> <br/>Saints, God loves us so much, HE GAVE us HIS Word to spare us, save us from the wrath to come. OBEY The Lord saints, FEAR the living God and crucify the flesh. UNTIL we see SIN THROUGH GOD's eyes, only then will we hate evil and then know what it is to FEAR HIM. Selah again.<br/>We are blessed and our days at New Covenant have been POWERFUL. I give thanks for such a Word HE gives us saints. What a day for us to RUN TO HIM and not hide FROM HIM. Do not let ISSUES keep you from HIS HOLY House or with HIS people.<br/> <br/>Lastly, I ask ALL you Elders from USA, Africa, India and Philippines, get STRONG WITH your wives. Your covenant in Christ is the strength of your ministry. It was God who said, Adam was not to be alone and thus brought Adam a help mate. Men of God, your strength lies in your companionship of your covenants with your wives. They ARE your companion&#x2019;s brothers, help metes and the measure of their love to you, brings stability to you. STAND WITH them in prayer and love and allow your ministries together, to be that which brings life. Antony, I pray you and Miriam really arise in Bungoma brother and together, you minister life to all. You to the saints, Miriam to the sisters, and bring hope and life and conviction to all. Raise Olga Ebony in the fear of God and bring Bungoma to a holy God felt cry. Greg and Christina, Terry and Lesley, Vincent and Sharon, LET YOUR LIVES together show life to all and stand strong in the faith. BRING LIFE to all in the Philippines and rejoice for the days are short and we have not many years left with each other. Allow your sons and daughters to have time with you IN Spirit and you &quot;daddy's&quot;, love your sons and daughters and protect them well. Brother Samuel in India, we stand with you and I am sorry I have forgotten your wives name, but greet her for us and your children,  and let her know YOU both are to bring life to those suffering. Remember Samuel, your wife, is your closest friend and companion in Christ, amen. To all of you other Elders here, REJOICE this day and know God is truly ministering life in this last hour.<br/> <br/>Lastly, I thank you all for your prayers. When New Covenant was born out of a Bible Study in my home in the fall of 1985, and then established on Passover Sunday in 1986, which was OUR first service AS New Covenant, I was only 35 years old saints. In a couple weeks, I will be 59. Life is passing by, and I do not know how much time I have left in this earth, before going into glory saints, but what time I have left, I will GIVE ALL I HAVE to sanctify the Word of God to all who shall hear. We will not always have each other saints and our days are shortened every new day of the rising sun. Therefore LOVE EACH other, and husbands and wives, LOVE each other, for each day is ONE LESS day you will have with each other. I pray to preach to my last breath saints, and I pray to go out in glory, preaching HIS Holy Word. To the YOUTH, I pray you young men be the next generation and you young ladies, be PURE and HOLY and keep yourselves protected.<br/> <br/>See you all soon, have a great week, seek HIM daily and may you ALL find peace and joy in obedience.  I pray you all continue to pray for the Windows of heaven to open and that we have what we need to touch as many as we can, for the days are evil saints and time is closing in. In HIS service, Kim<br/>
