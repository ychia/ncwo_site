		<p>New Covenant Christian Center, International is a ministry dedicated to Discipleship training and equipping the saints to Spiritual Maturity to do the work of ministry by edifying the Body of Christ in this earth. Our foundation is built upon preparing the saints for what we call the SENT MINISTRY to the nations of the world, by teaching and building on the Apostolic Ministry that built the Book of Acts. The vision and creation of this ministry came back in August of 1984 on a back dirt road while preaching the Kingdom of God in Kitale, Kenya. For this cause, the Lord said to bring this vision back to America and HE would bring men that would be trained, prepared and equipped to be "SENT" to the nations to feed the hungry, clothe the poor and distribute the Word of God freely. In Discipleship, the first thing converts are taught is the growing process from spiritual babes to the fully matured. One must also come to know that Jesus Christ, nor the Apostles EVER preached "Christianity", they preached THE KINGDOM OF GOD!</p>


		<p>As you enter this site, you will find many wonderful and powerful teachings as well as witness and SEE with your eyes, the awesome glory of our Father in Heaven as we reach the nations of the World with our World Outreach Ministry. The teachings are powerful and cause one to truly search their hearts to see whether they be IN THE FAITH--II Cor.13:5 As you walk through this wonderful sight dedicated to Jesus Christ and the POWER of the Word of God, we pray you will with OPEN Bible, "Study to shew yourself approved unto God"--II Tim.2:15</p>


		<p>The foundation of New Covenant is built upon the "Oracles of God" found in Hebrews 5:8-6:2. These are otherwise known as the Doctrine of Christ. The Bible says that anyone who does not know the Doctrine of Christ is but a babe and unskillful in the word of righteousness. For this cause, Discipleship truly must grasp your heart with a desire to change from glory to glory. Converts are won to Jesus Christ, but DISCIPLES are made! Jesus commanded us to make disciples by getting others to OBSERVE us and watch us as we are to be Ambassadors for Christ and NOT OF THIS WORLD! We preach the Kingdom of God and expose the fallacies and false teachings of Christianity and the doctrines of men. There are over 250 different denominations and organizations in America alone who call themselves "Christian", yet Jesus Christ said there is ONE way, ONE truth, ONE life and ONE door into the eternal Kingdom, of which few will find.</p>


		<p>We have a plurality of Elders in this body of believers here, just as the scriptures teach. No one man is exalted, lifted up with titles or positions, for only Jesus Christ is exalted in the Kingdom of God. You will find many wonderful teachings in this sight, even as to why there is NO SUCH Title in the New Testament as Senior Pastor. The gifts given by Jesus Christ himself, The Apostle, The Prophet, The Evangelist, The Shepherd and teacher, are NOT titles affixed to a man's name, but rather mantles or anointings that Elders in the faith are blessed with. Our ministries consist of World Outreach to the nations, The School of Christ Bible College, Christian PreSchool with a K-High School, Prison, Hospital and Food ministry. Our World Outreach ministry has sent two families to live full time in the Philippines and one to Kenya Africa, with support outreaches to Uganda and India as well. We study from and learn from ONE book; The Holy Word of God authorized by the King James Bible only. Be blessed with what you shall now enter into.</p>
