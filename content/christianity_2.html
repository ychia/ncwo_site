			<h2>Kingdom of God vs Christianity</h2>
			<em>part two</em>
		</div>
		<div class="clearfix"></div>


		From the scriptures we see God did not birth Christianity; He birthed the kingdom of God. Many today presume wrongly that Christianity is the kingdom of God, but when we compare them side-by-side we see they are far from compatible or even complementary, rather they are at great odds with each other. When true kingdom preaching comes it will expose and shatter the teachings and doings of Christianity. Psalm 50. Christianity is built on men's views, opinions, and doctrines, whereas the kingdom of God is built on the authority of God after the pattern of the Word of God, from which if we are truly in submission to the Lord's authority we cannot add to, take away from, nor deviate from. Ultimately, then, Christianity is nothing more than the kingdoms of men, built off of the authority of men. Men's kingdoms are as rampant today as in Jesus' day and even as Jesus had in his day so we have in our modern day Pharisees, Saduccess, Herodians, Samaritans, Nicolaitanes, Laodiceans, on and on, every denomination under the sun.<br/><br/>Forty in the scriptures is always the number representing testing. This is why Moses was 40 years in the desert being prepared by God to lead His people and 40 days &amp; nights in the mount with God (Ex 24:18, 34:28, Dt 9:9,11,18,25, 10:10, Ac 7:30) receiving the commandments of God. This is why 40 days the land of Canaan was searched by the 12 spies to see if the land was good (Num 14:33-34) and this is why the people of the Exodus were put to the test for 40 years (Ex 16:35, Num 32:13, Dt 2:7, 8:2-4, 29:5, Jos 5:6, Neh 9:21, Ps 95:10, Am 2:10, 5:25, Ac 7:36,42, 13:18, Heb 3:9,17) to see if they would hearken to God's authority or not. No more than 40 stripes could be given for punishment (Dt 25:3). Under the judges Othniel, Barak, and Gideon the land had rest 40 years (Jdg 3:11, 5:31, 8:28). The first 3 kings of Israel, Saul (Ac 13:21), David, and Solomon all ruled 40 years as God's people were being put to the test. Goliath taunted the armies of Israel for 40 days (1Sam 17:16). Elijah ate and drank, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto the mount of God (1K 19:8). Ezekiel laid on his side for the sin of Judah for 40 days (Eze 4:6). Egypt would lay desolate for 40 years (Eze 29:11-13). Ninevah was given 40 days to repent before it would be overthrown (Jon 3:4). Jesus was in the wilderness fasting and praying 40 days (Mt 4:2/Mk1:13/Lk 4:2). Jesus showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them 40 days (Acts 1:3). <br/><br/>Let us now put to the test Christianity and the kingdom of God to see what stands according to the pattern of the Word of God. Having been born-again and yet in Christianity many years myself I know how easily it is to be offended by someone who speaks against what you believe has helped you so much and what is your life. Remember Christianity didn't save you, Jesus Christ did, and Jesus never preached Christianity. He preached the kingdom of God and so did all of his followers. If some of these things should offend you, remember if we are truly children of God, then we must receive His correction &amp; hear when through His word He reproves us (Heb 12:8). God says, &quot;Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.&quot; (Pr 1:23) &quot;The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise. He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding. For reproofs of instruction are the way of life.&quot; (Pr 15:31-32, 6:23)<br/><br/>As the people of God, we are all called to &quot;have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them&quot; and that by the light of God's word (Eph 5:11,13) This is what the scripture was given to us for: for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be thoroughly furnished (2Tim. 3:16-17). If we want to be furnished by the word of God we must receive reproof, correction, and instruction from it, but first (after doctrine) note comes reproof. So receive these words as King David would when he said, &quot;Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head&quot; (Ps 141:5)<br/><br/>
