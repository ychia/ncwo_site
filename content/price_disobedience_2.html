      <h2>Why Disobedience Hinders the Righteous Cause</h2>

    <div class="clearfix"></div>

   Praise the Lord and God bless you God fearing saints this Thursday evening.  The other day I wrote to you all about COUNTING THE COST, The Price of Disobedience without Repentance. Tonight I will share about WHY disobedience HINDERS the righteous cause of God. God does NOT move through sinful hearts or those with sin in their lives, unless you make your lives RIGHT with God, in repentance unto righteousness unto holiness perfecting holiness in the fears of God. The teaching the other day was PERSONALLY for us ALL to embrace, for it showed those who confess to be saved, confess to be born again, if they live in disobedience without Godly sorrow in repentance, they will bring damnation and corruption upon themselves. When we sin, we sin AGAINST God Almighty, and Jesus NEVER gave us a license to sin. Please read, I Jn.3 the WHOLE chapter. Many times I have to deal with issues in life, sin in the camp of God's people, yet I deal with it in love and kindness, but sometimes in correction and the rod of authority. Sometimes I have to write letters corporately, as living Epistles of truth, speaking ONLY THAT IS ALREADY written, the Holy Word of God. Sometimes, I have to be bold and strong, even making some sorry by the letters written, yet I always pray one sorrows UNTO REPENTANCE and obeys the voice of God. <br/><br/>2 Cor. 7:9-10 <br/>    Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. [10] For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. <br/><br/>What I write tonight, I write by the Spirit of God to SHOW all of you copied, how the innocent and righteous cause of God is hindered when we OPEN the door to Satan and allow the Devil entrance to our lives spiritually. HOW can we be SENT To nations to save souls, make disciples and preach the fear of God, IF we do NOT fear God ourselves? Our lives, our marriages, our examples are to the nations! What we do, we do because God said so. Be not deceived saints, just because you sin and ask forgiveness does not always mean you TRULY repented, and if your repentance was worldly, meaning YOU ONLY repented because you got caught, you shall surely die in your sins and your disobedience remains uncovered, unportered and unrighteous. NOW do you begin to ask yourselves WHY Paul said we are to work out our salvation in FEAR and TREMBLING?  How many truly do this today? Paul made people sorry by his letters, but that is because their HEARTS were pricked. I wonder at times, how many are made sorry by what I write or share? How many truly hit their knees asking God to forgive them. I know some, who NEVER even respond to me anymore, have cut me off from their lives. HOW do you cut off a servant of God, a man of God called and SENT, HOW do you cut someone off like that and get into heaven and the Holy City? You do NOT, saints. Paul talked about two kinds of SORROW. GODLY sorrow which brings repentance and that brings FRUIT. <br/><br/>Matthew 3:8 <br/>    Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: <br/><br/>Acts 26:20 <br/>    But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. <br/><br/>This means GODLY sorrow, will work repentance in your life TO SALVATION, BUT, BUT, BUT the sorrow of the WORLD, that is what worketh death. IF you truly repent saints of your sins, you are upright, strong again, forgiven and you bear fruit. YOU NEVER leave God, nor walk away saints and say you have repented. How many today, have death working IN THEM and they think heaven awaits? HOW many refuse to hear men of God and wise counsel, but RUN to and SEEK after teachers having itching ears and refuse to hear SOUND DOCTRINE? We warned about the last days and those that will FORSAKE the blood of Jesus ALL in the name of Jesus. They will no longer hear sound doctrine, but will turn their ears FROM the truth, and seek after teachers having itching ears. <br/><br/>2 Tim. 4:3-4 <br/>    For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; [4] And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. <br/><br/>In other words, they will find false preachers and false teachers who KNOW Christianity, but KNOW NOT the Kingdom of God. Death awaits them all. WHO do you think you will stand before some day? My Lord saints, open your eyes. The LARGEST &quot;church&quot; in America today has over 45,000 people, yet the preacher REFUSES to speak on SIN. He says sin is NOT on his menu in his church. YET, he proclaims to be born again, a word of faith preacher, and his doctrine is NOT sound and NOT Kingdom. Read Rev.1 and see WHOM YOU WILL SEE face to face one day BEFORE you are allowed entrance into the Holy City. John was IN the Spirit on the Lord's day, the last living of the original 12, and he saw Jesus glorified and eyes of FIRE, and fell DEAD at HIS feet. IF John the beloved, fell as DEAD at Jesus feet, WHO do WE think WE are? THAT is the Jesus we will ALL stand before. When men of God come to you WITH the Bible, and show YOU the scriptures, teach you the error of your ways, you better know them well, for you can NOT hide from God Almighty. And IF, yes, IF Godly sorrow has worked in your heart after sin, you will go and SIN NO MORE! You will live Godly, clearing yourselves of the sinful matter. You will arise with indignation in your heart with sorrow you sinned. You will walk in the fear of God, have a vehement desire to serve holiness, have a zeal now for God, and REVENGE against Disobedience by living OBEDIENTLY. <br/><br/>2 Cor. 7:11 <br/>    For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter. <br/><br/>2 Cor. 10:6 <br/>

      And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled. <br/><br/>Now, saints, God sees us as a BODY, the body of Christ. HIS son, HIS bridegroom to be married to HIS bride. Will our Father in heaven bring LIFE in the earth through carnality, sin, adulteries, fornications, flesh, lasciviousness? Will God bring HIS glory into the earth with a sinning people? God forbid. When we are born again, we DIE to the old nature, the old man, and put on Jesus Christ. WE arise in newness of life and walk in newness of life and become the BRIDE to be. IF we sin, we repent, make it right with God and go and sin no more. We are commanded by God to be without spot, without blemish. Our Father will NEVER join to HIS beloved son, our Lord Jesus Christ, a bride that is tainted, defiled, touched by the world. When God sees US, HE sees us as one body, the body of Christ, Jesus being the head, we as INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS, NOT independent individuals!!  Many live their lives today by their OWN reasoning, OWN choices, OWN decisions, and are Christians INDEPENDENT of authority, NO fear of God, NO subjection to authority and NO submission. Fornications run rampant, adulteries and divorces rampant. What will GOD DO ON THAT day? I pray you know. They are INDEPENDENT individuals. YET, the true body of Christ, are MEMBERS of one body and when ONE sins, we ALL feel it and will be partakers of that judgment, IF that sin is NOT dealt with!!<br/><br/>This past Tuesday night in SOC at the House of God, the fire of God descended upon us as cloven tongues of fire. Tuesday night saints this past week, was really fearful and POWERFUL, and Romans 5,6,7,8 and Joshua 6,7,8 were ministered from about WHAT sin does to a believer. The power of the Word, the conviction of the Holy Spirit, filled the sanctuary. This weekend, after Sunday, Tuesday night will be downloaded for it was recorded. IF you were not there Tuesday, YOU must take the time soon to HEAR what the Spirit of God pricked ALL our hearts with and TAKE IT TO HEART. Oh, saints, I give thanks for the Apostle Jesus Christ in our lives and I THANK God we have a ministry here built upon the foundations of the Apostles and Prophets of Jesus Christ. The HOLY Bible and ONLY the KJV Holy Bible is our foundation. WHEN YOU REFUSE in life to seek the Word or when men of God come asking YOU to sit in the Word, if you reject that, damnation awaits and be not deceived. God ordained and set holy men of God over your lives to protect YOU. HOW do we reject such men of God as servants of the Lord? Do we not fear God? WE are ONLY born again BY the Word of God!!<br/><br/>1 Cor. 5:1-7 <br/>    It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. [2] And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you. [3] For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed, [4] In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, [5] To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. [6] Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? [7] Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: <br/><br/>Here in Corinth, a man was living in fornication. Doing fornication. Fornicating sexually AND with the flesh in the world. Paul REBUKED, not the man committing such, but rebuked the SAINTS as being puffed up that they did NOT MOURN this sin in their midst and the one doing it was NOT removed from among them. Sure, if this man had repented, asked forgiveness and wept before God, the blood of Jesus would have cleansed him and made him free. Yet Paul told the SAINTS, their glorying, their Praising, was NOT GOOD for this man did not repent and did NOT make it right with God. He shared how ONE lump of leaven, sin, will leaven the WHOLE body! PURGE OUT therefore that lump. Saints, when sin is IN the camp, the righteous suffer if that sin is not removed. <br/><br/>Fornication will get NO man and NO woman into heaven. The Holy City does not await whoremongers. IF you fornicate, YOU MUST repent, stop and if you can not contain yourselves physically, YOU MUST GET MARRIED, for better to marry than Burn in lust, Paul said, <br/><br/>1 Cor. 7:9-11 <br/>    But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn. [10] And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband: [11] But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife. <br/><br/>You young men and women of God today, REMAIN HOLY and pure. And you do NOT have to be young to commit such sin. Once married, they have now made VOWS and God will hold them to it. THEY must honor their marriage now, and NOT break it, for God immediately speaks by commandment the marriage vows MUST NOW be kept. Read that verse above again. When sin enters the camp saints, and not just sexual sins, SINS saints, if they continue, your hearts are dead and not alive. Yet sins and DISOBEDIENCE HINDER the righteous cause. The HEART OF FLESH remains veiled and it MUST turn to the Lord to be free. Sin BLINDS saints, SIN HARDENS saints, SIN is deceitful. Marriages DIE because of such and this ought NOT to be in Christ. Jesus did NOT come and die for us, so we could live in sin, the flesh and make our OWN choices in life. HE came to make us OBEY God the Father. Jesus said, IF YOU LOVE me, you will KEEP my commandments. For those who commit adultery, I shared in my last letter, it is to be forgiven!! Does God permit a marriage covenant to end because one commits adultery? Yes HE does if the vows are broken, but ONLY the innocent one who was NOT in the adultery, they are the ones who must decide, NOT the sinner. Yet Jesus, FORGAVE Adultery and said GO AND SIN NO MORE to the woman in Jn.8. In other words, GO HOME TO YOUR husband. IF a man commits adultery, his wife is to forgive him for her love is to be greater than his sin. Her pain will continue, but God will help her and the husband must go home to his wife, for she MUST forgive him. If a wife commits adultery against her husband, his love is to be greater than her sin, and as Jesus forgives, her husband is to love her as Christ loves the church and he MUST forgive her and if he does, she is NOT free to walk away, NOT free to go on in life, for she is BOUND to the law of her husband. THAT is the Word of God saints. ROMANS 7:1-4. Saints, HOW do we think our lives can be lived in the flesh and of this world without consequences eternally?  The Kingdom of God is NOT of this world. 

       <div class="sword_sidebox" style="width: 200px;">
      <p>Romans 7:1-4<br/> Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</p>

      <br/><br/>YET today, sins permeate the body of Christ and the Lord can NOT bless a body where sins continue to go unrepented of.  When saints sin, and keep hidden sins going on without making restitution with God, then the Lord God withholds blessings, provisions, and HIS mighty ways, when sin is in the camp. To the Corinthians, their glorying was NOT good while sin was in the camp. In Joshua, please read chapters 6,7,8 as we taught on Tuesday night. ONE man sinned, Achan, yet God was angry with ALL Israel and said, ISRAEL has transgressed MY COVENANT and sinned against me. Yet saints,, ONE man sinned, yet ALL Israel paid the price. Why? Because God did NOT see Israel as individuals, but rather HIS PEOPLE, and when ONE brought sin into the camp, all paid the price UNTIL that sin was removed. Achan, his wife, children, ox, sheep, cattle, ALL possessions were stoned to death and burned. Then God moved Israel forward and blessed them. Read Deut. 28 and KNOW, God withholds blessings from the sinful in heart. <br/><br/>DO WE DARE sin against God and not repent? Do you Elders and your wives in the nations, not preach on such? Do we take such lightly? Oh, repentance is NOT saying I AM SORRY GOD, repentance tears the heart to bear fruit and have an earnest pain for sinning. God said, MAKE YOUR LIVES right. IF you fornicate, MARRY. If you adulterate, speak truth, ask forgiveness, and when given, remain IN that marriage, for God is not a liar that HE should lie. CARNALITY is killing the body of Christ today. Natural mindedness is killing the body of Christ today. SO many take sin lightly, and even preachers say, NO PROBLEM, it is okay, Jesus loves you and it is alright, for we are sinners saved by grace. This is a false preacher, for though WE WERE sinners saved by grace, when we sin, or fall, GOD MAKES A WAY HIS WAY to heal and cover. Yet we do NOT live in sin anymore. BUT when WE put on our fig leaves and aprons to cover OUR SINS OUR way, then God is shamed and your sin continues. I do not care HOW many &quot;churches&quot; you change to go to, your sin remains. WHY? Because Jesus Christ said to the CHURCH, HIS BODY, if you leave your first love, sin and go, you MUST GO HOME, and go BACK and remember WHERE you fell from, then do your first works. Oh, that destroys MANY theologies today, does it not? Many preachers say, it is ok, sister, brother, you can GO ON WITH GOD NOW, move on, HE is at peace, when God is NOT at peace and ONE CAN NOT move on, but then again, SIN blinds and kills.<br/><br/>Saints, we at New Covenant have a ministry to the nations. WE SEND families, husbands, wives, children to NATIONS. DO WE DARE put them in harms way by sins? Do WE open the door of the devil against the body? Jesus said, the gates of HELL could not come against, us. But Jesus was talking about a righteous God fearing people.  IF we sin, we repent and make it right and go and SIN NO MORE. Disobedience brings the wrath of God, and ONE day, when we stand before the Jesus of Rev.1, MANY will hear, DEPART FROM ME you workers of lawlessness and disobedience. HOW sad to think you live on earth headed to heaven, when hell awaits because a heart was COLD, and dead by the deceitfulness of sin. WE can NOT put our brethren in harms way. When Joshua sent his men into battle in chapter 7, these were his friends, Mighty Men of Valour, husbands, fathers, soldiers. Yet they were brutally killed by the King of Ai and his men, and Joshua wept from morning to night. Joshua cried out, OH GOD WHY? Many times I cry to God, WHY are we hindered, WHY do see not see more of YOUR glory? Then sin always comes up and sins are found out. I know how much I suffer in life now, being a preacher of righteousness, knowing that attacked my life and ministry. I suffer much in life, not just for righteousness sake, for that is an honor, but also for sins committed against me, and that is what hurts deeply. Yet God in HIS love and mercy, HE forgives, Praise God, but we then MUST DO as HE says to see the fruits of such forgiveness. <br/><br/>Saints, I could write for hours. Yet I finish on this. WE withhold the blessings of God in our lives and the nations when SIN enters our lives. Can we afford such a life? I have seen what sin did in Kenya Africa and I have fought diligently the past two and half years to overcome that. SOON, this week, Charles goes again and God will use him to FIGHT the good fight of faith. I dedicated my life to Africa, was SENT so many times. In my pioneering days, years of travels, being in Africa alone on 7 journeys by myself in years past, I laid foundations for others to be sent. My wife Olga, once at my side, stood proudly and boldly in Uganda and Kenya, teaching women, what I taught men, yet again, look what Satan did. I have seen what sin did in the Philippines. I spent years there living out of suitcases, in hard conditions to build a ministry and Kingdom order and outreaches, yet look what happened. Now this year, since December, I have been there four times rebuilding and STILL now must deal again with issues that should NEVER BE NAMED ONCE amongst us who believe. WHEN WILL WE get the fear of God in our lives? I dedicated my life I have preached my heart and soul out to get saints to OBEY Jesus Christ. I have shared many times, what it takes God YEARS to build in your lives, Satan can DESTROY IT ALL in a moment of sin, pleasure, and it takes longer to REBUILD something than build it. Just in marriages alone, it takes a lifetime of covenant to grow more and more in love and closer in the beauty of what God can join IN Spirit. Yet only a moment of time can kill all. It may take a year to build a building, yet one can blow it up in TEN seconds of time. You can have years of discipleship and labor in your life, and be taken down in a moment of time, if you give place. Sin touches NOT just the life of the one committing sin, it touches the WHOLE body of Christ. God does NOT permit us to violate our vows unto HIM in anything we do. WE must honor HIM all the days of our lives, serve HIM all the days of our lives, GROW in holiness, ALL the days of our lives. . Jesus said, ONE way, ONE truth, ONE life, ONE door. God has but ONE way to rebuild our lives and cover our sins. ONE way saints. IF we live in sin, commit sins, and then walk away as if nothing is wrong, many righteous suffer. The Israelites suffered from ONE man's sin and 36 faithful men died in Joshua 7. In Nu.16, ONE man's sin, Korah, caused 14,950 to perish. IN Corinth, ONE man's sin, caused a whole city of believers to have a glory not good. <br/><br/>I pray today, we ALL live holy Godly lives. I pray we repent, go home to where God called us to be. I will spend my life to my dying breath, preaching Jesus Christ and HIM crucified. I will spend my last days going still to the nations to preach obedience.  I pray we remember this ministry and those baptized into this body, saved in this body, would God EVER remove you? NEVER. I ask you all to come home if your heart has wandered and coming home, let God heal you and restore you. Judgment day draws nigh saints, be ready, be prepared. I want to see the nations THRIVE in HIS glory, power and resources. I grow weary in life seeing what sin does and what those who repent not do to the innocent. Either, way, though the righteous suffer NOW, the Holy City awaits you. For the unrighteous, disobedience, unrepentant, I weep for what is coming. Saints, DISOBEDIENCE brings damnation. One can STILL say they said sorry to God and perish. ONLY obeying God HIS way, will save our souls. LETS ALL LIVE LIVES worthy of HIS calling and purpose. You Elders and wives in the nations, be ye HOLY for HOLY is HE who called you. Be the light to the flock, lead by example, and fear God. <br/><br/>Saints, do NOT play with your salvation. <br/><br/>Philip. 2:11-16 <br/>    And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. <br/>    [12] Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. [13] For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. [14] Do all things without murmurings and disputings: [15] That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; [16] Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. <br/><br/>2 Peter 2:20-21 <br/>    For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. [21] For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. <br/><br/>Romans 13:2 <br/>    Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. <br/><br/>1 Tim. 5:12 <br/>    Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith. <br/><br/>Rev. 2:4-5 <br/>    Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. [5] Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. <br/><br/>DO YOU REALLY believe God means that? When one truly repents, they GO HOME, to where the Father birthed them and raised them IN KINGDOM power, not Christianity.  Once you find KINGDOM and FIND Kingdom truth, you are BOUND now forever. When vows are made IN the Kingdom, only death can bring them to pass. The Prodigal son repented but did NOT continue down his own path, he went HOME. Do likewise. Let us remember the body of Christ and remember OUR obedience takes REVENGE on disobedience. Let not the righteous cause SUFFER by our lack and unwillingness to repent. <br/><br/> 1 Cor. 15:50 <br/>    Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. <br/><br/>Galatians 6:7-8 <br/>    Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. [8] For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. <br/><br/>For those of you unmarried, remain HOLY and pure, let the marriage bed be UNDEFILED and make your vows and keep them. For those married, HONOR your wives, HONOR your husbands and let nothing separate you from the joining where YOU BOTH became ONE in body by the Spirit of God. . Saints, in the nations, as well as here, LIVE your lives according to scripture and NOT views and opinions. May we ALL live our lives out according to holiness, fear of God, repentance and be ye transformed. THE NATIONS depend on OUR lives here saints. Next time you even THINK about sin, THINK about the saints. Most who sin, only LUST for themselves and never give thought to HOW MANY will suffer hurt, pain, and devastation by what they do. BE YE HOLY and sin not. REPENT, turn around, and get back on HIS path. Elders in the nations, do NOT let sin be taken lightly. It effects THE RIGHTEOUS CAUSE. Olga, I love you. God bless you all, Brother Kim
