		We as the children of God are forever learning the power of the Word of God. We are instructed in Isaiah 50:4 to be taught the &quot;TONGUE&quot; of the learned. We are instructed by Jesus himself that we should not live on bread alone, but on EVERY WORD that proceedeth out of the mouth of God--Mt.4:4. Please pray and meditate upon that which you will now read. May the Holy Spirit lead, guide and direct your paths into all truth. <br/><br/>When John the Baptist became the voice crying in the wilderness, he came preaching--&quot;Repent ye: for the KINGDOM of Heaven is at hand&quot;. Mt.3:1-2. When Jesus now arrived on the scene, this is what is recorded in the scriptures: &quot;Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the KINGDOM of God, and saying, &quot;The time is fulfilled, and the KINGDOM of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel&quot;--Mark 1:14-15. Just after the resurrection, Jesus spent forty days before his final ascension to the right hand of the Father, &quot;speaking of the things (to his disciples) pertaining to the KINGDOM of God&quot;--Acts 1:3 &quot;But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the KINGDOM of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women&quot;--Acts 8:12 Speaking of Paul and Barnabus on their FIRST journey as Apostles, &quot;Confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the KINGDOM of God&quot;--Acts 14:22 Speaking of Paul, &quot;And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the KINGDOM of God&quot;--Acts 19:8 Speaking of Paul, &quot;And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the KINGDOM of God, shall see my face no more&quot;--Acts 20:25 Speaking of Paul in his final days in Rome, &quot;And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him in his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the KINGDOM of God&quot;--Acts 28:23 and &quot;And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, Preaching the KINGDOM of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him&quot;--Acts 28:31 . The phrase &quot;KINGDOM&quot; is used over 150 times in the New Testament. The phrase &quot;CHRISTIANITY&quot; is used 0 (zero). <br/><br/>So let us first establish the foundation that John the Baptist (shadow and type of the church), Jesus and the Apostles, NEVER preached &quot;Christianity&quot;: they preached the KINGDOM of God. Jesus said that if a man be Born-Again he will &quot;see&quot; the Kingdom of God--Jn.3:3. Not someday when you die, but NOW!! The Kingdom of God is in the realm of the invisible. It is the spiritual realm in which we are to live, think, see, walk and perceive, for the word &quot;see&quot; means to perceive. This is why the carnal man, the natural man is at enmity with God--Romans 8:5-9 He is blinded to the spirit and Jesus said in Luke 17:20 that the Kingdom of God cannot be seen with a natural eye!! Paul continually told us to not be moved by the seen or visible world, but by the spiritual--the unseen--II Cor.4:17-18 In the Kingdom of God, there is power, authority, discipline and above all--ORDER!! The government of God is the very foundation upon which we are to submit and follow after. It is very orderly and there are rules that we must obey and follow. I will share more about the realm of the Kingdom in part II. <br/><br/>Only 3 times, yes, only 3 times in the scriptures will you find the word &quot;Christian&quot;. First, it is found in Acts 11:26 where it says that the DISCIPLES were first called &quot;Christians&quot; in Antioch. Note my friends--DISCIPLES, not believers, but DISCIPLES were called Christians. Disciples are disciplined, obedient, students and pupils of the Lord Jesus. It is shameful what men do today all in the name of &quot;Christianity&quot;. No wonder there is no power or fear of God. Men who call themselves &quot;Christian Leaders&quot; live in homosexuality, committing vile, filthy, ungodly acts with each other that even animals do not do. Women who call themselves &quot;Christians&quot;, live as lesbians and some are even ordained today into ministry. What an abomination in the sight of a holy God!! People everywhere call themselves Christians today, because man and the devil have made &quot;Christianity&quot; into a sloppy grace, easy believism life. In today's standards, all you have to do is believe in Jesus and you are a &quot;Christian&quot;. Well, I guess that makes Satan a Christian, the demons Christians and fallen angels Christians, all because they believe in Jesus. It was Born-Again DISCIPLES that were called Christians. But notice, they preached--THE KINGDOM!! Then in Acts 26:28, King Agrippa said that Paul almost convinced him to be a Christian. Why? Because Paul was a holy and pure man of God. He preached with power and authority and brought conviction to this man. And finally in I Peter 4:16, &quot;Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf&quot;. <br/><br/>So what happened? Where did the power go? Where did the preaching of the Kingdom go? When satan saw that he could not stop the powerful move of God in this earth by martyring and persecuting the disciples in the early centuries, he finally came up with the greatest deceptive plan. If he could not kill them and stop them, why not join them. Religion was born!! All in the guise of &quot;Christianity&quot;. When Constantine called for Christianity to become the &quot;religion&quot; of Rome, then satan found his seat. To the church of Pergamos in Rev.2:13, Jesus talks about a church where &quot;satans seat&quot; would be, yet it would hold to the name of Jesus. Say hello to Roman Catholicism. The beginning to &quot;Christianity&quot;. A great vail and mask of deception right out of the abyss of Babylonian culture, yet disguised. The tree of life (the Kingdom) was now replaced by the tree of the knowledge of good (religion) and evil. Both of death. Throughout the centuries, Roman Catholicism captured the world. In Europe, all the great explorers were Catholics. They spread their disease of religion around the world through their explorations. The great Harlot (whore) of Babylon--Rev.17 was now in the process of spreading. Did you know that Christopher Columbus, who everybody hales as such a great &quot;Christian&quot; explorer was a Roman Catholic? Did you know that he forced, split families apart and enslaved tribal people to take back to Europe and Spain to show how good he was in spreading what he called &quot;Christianity&quot;? Did you know that Christopher Columbus NEVER, set foot on the North American continent? Did you know that he DID NOT discover America? It was an explorer named Amerigo Vespucious, and this is why we are called America--after his first name--Amerigo. That is just for your information. Anyway, as Catholicism plagued the world, we went into the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;. I thought Jesus said we were the LIGHT of the World? When this beast was at its highest glory, the world was in the dark ages. That should speak enough on its own about the spirit behind Catholicism. In the late 1500's, the PROTESTant movement began in protest to the teachings. But through all of this, we still have the tree of Good and Evil. Today we have Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran, Methodist, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Assemblies of God, Word of Faith, and it goes on and on and on. <br/><br/>There are now over 250 different religious organizations in America alone. Over 250 different doctrines, dogmas and denominations ALL in the name of &quot;Christianity&quot;. Think about it!! The Mormon Cult--one faith. The Jehovah Witness Cult--one faith. The Hari Krishna Cult--one faith. The Buddhist Cult--one faith. The Tao-Zen Cult--one faith. The Shingmuu Cult--one faith. And the most demonic and terroristic cult of Islam--one faith. But in &quot;Christianity&quot; over 250, over 250, over 250!!! Different directions, beliefs, doctrines. It is called LEAVEN!! The LEAVEN of the Pharisees. False teachings!! Satan has done his job well. A house divided cannot stand. The world looks to Christianity and sees nothing. They look to the Roman Catholic Church as being the powerhouse of religion. Jesus Christ said, &quot;I am THE way--not ways, THE truth--not truths, THE life--not lifes and THE door--not doors&quot;. Seek ye first--THE KINGDOM, he said. The Kingdom belongs to the FATHER. HIS son, is the King of this domain. The masses today are the many going the way of destruction. They are lost, the walking dead. They have no fear of God. They have no relationship or knowledge of the Word of God. A Bible is only a book collecting dust on their shelves if they even own one. Over 85% of seminary graduates, whether Catholic or Protestant do not even believe in Adam and Eve or the virgin birth. Their religion has blinded them and their heart is covered with a veil. <br/><br/>America is dying. Her judgment is going to be great. Religious freedom has killed her. Everybody says, &quot;Let us just put away our doctrinal indifference's and just lift up Jesus&quot;. The day you put away doctrine is the day you die. Many stand and preach about a Jesus they do not even know. Paul warned us in II Cor.11:3-15 and in Gal.1 about false gospels, false Jesus' and those that would be deceived. It was not heathen unbelievers that beat and crucified Jesus. It was those who said they were believers and that their God was Father in Heaven. In this day, your greatest foe will not be the heathen unbelievers. It will be those who say they are believers in Christ. Learn the Word. Live the Word. Know the Word and Preach the Word. You will be amazed at how many who say they believe will become offended at you. The gates of Hell are packed daily with congestion. We pass laws to give out condoms as freedom of expression, yet we cannot pray in our schools. What a sick society, full of hypocrisy. We allow pornography free on the Internet and in our schools and libraries, freely protected, yet we cannot pray in our schools. Well let me finish for now on this!! Maybe &quot;Christians&quot; have been told they can not pray. But we are to be of the Kingdom of God. Jesus said the Kingdom of God suffers violence, but the violent take it by force. Are you the violent? Are you bold enough to say enough is enough? Are you proud to stand persecuted and afflicted for taking a stand on the Word of God. Even though my child will never see a public school, all I can say is that if she did, she would certainly begin her day in prayer. <br/><br/>&quot;Christianity&quot; is nothing more than a world full of views, opinions, doctrines, beliefs and dead works. It is mans way of trying to &quot;think&quot; what God is all about. Stop any ten people at random on the streets and a good 9 out of 10 will say they are Christian. Then ask them questions about the Word of God. The Kingdom of God. The Lord Jesus Christ. Do not be surprised when they cannot answer you. May we grow in knowledge and grace. I shall continue. For now, be blessed and know that &quot;Christianity&quot; cannot save a man. But the blood of Jesus can. May God have mercy on our souls. One last thing to give thought to. Keep your ears open to listen to how men speak. In this hour you will hear &quot;Christ and God&quot; but very, very little will be said about &quot;Jesus and the Father&quot;.
